## "On How Much to Protect the Prince from Himself"

**Everyone agrees** that a prince should be shielded from his enemies—that loyal servants must guard against external threats. **Nevertheless**, experience shows that princes more often fall to their own vices than to foreign swords. The wise gatekeeper understands he must protect the prince not only from assassins but from the prince himself. Power is a mirror that magnifies virtues and distorts flaws. Those who serve princes must **either** speak truth and risk wrath, **or** speak comfort and ensure ruin. **There is no middle course.** The gatekeeper who attempts to soften hard truths while avoiding confrontation achieves neither safety nor service—he merely delays catastrophe while earning contempt.

In the March of Valdaro, Prince Lorenzo ruled from the gray fortress of Montefioro. His father had forged the march from warring barons through iron and cunning. Lorenzo inherited vigor and vice in equal measure. At twenty-eight, he commanded five thousand spears. His table groaned with boar and wine. Courtiers called him the Lion of Valdaro. Rinaldo served as First Gatekeeper—a scarred condottiero from the Tuscan hills who understood that men are slaves to their appetites until necessity teaches them restraint. Rinaldo had saved Lorenzo's life at the Battle of the Red Ford when a Milanese lance pierced the prince's shield. Rinaldo took the blow. **Hence**, he stood at the prince's right hand, bearing both scar and authority.

Lorenzo's flaw was dice—not mere diversion but obsession. He wagered manors, horses, even border forts. In the high chamber, under torchlight, he played with nobles from the south: Counts of Ravenna, Barons of Ferrara. They came with heavy purses and heavier schemes. Wins swelled his coffers. Losses carved his lands like a butcher's blade through meat.

One autumn, whispers reached Rinaldo. The prince had lost the valley of Prato to Count Ludovico of Ravenna. Prato held the only ford across the Arno tributary. Without it, Valdaro's grain wagons would bog in mud. **Therefore**, famine loomed if rains swelled the river. Rinaldo confronted Lorenzo at dawn. The prince lay abed, head pounding from vintage.

"The valley is gone, my lord," Rinaldo said. "Ludovico holds the deeds. Your seal marks them."

Lorenzo laughed. "A trifle. I win it back tonight." For men are so constructed that victory at games convinces them of destiny's favor, while defeat merely sharpens their appetite for the next throw.

Rinaldo knelt. "Ludovico brings marked bones. His man confessed it. You lose Prato. Then the march starves."

The prince rose. Eyes like flint. "You doubt me?"

"I see the fact. You prevail if you act."

**If anyone were to say** that Rinaldo should have let the prince learn through loss, **I would answer** that some lessons kill the student. The gatekeeper who watches his master walk into ruin, thinking pain will teach wisdom, forgets that dead princes learn nothing.

That night, Rinaldo barred the high chamber. Sentries at every door. "No game tonight, my lord. The count departs at first light."

Lorenzo raged. Shattered a goblet against stone. "Traitor! I command here!"

Rinaldo stood unmoved. "Command tomorrow. Prato feeds the march. Lose it, and barons revolt."

Ludovico sneered from the hall. "The Lion fears the roll."

Rinaldo seized the count's cloak. Dragged him to the gates. Horses saddled. "Ride north. Or taste Valdaro steel."

Dawn broke. Lorenzo brooded in the solar. Rinaldo entered with maps. "Prato's peasants send word. Ludovico demands double harvest or threatens war. He masses riders at the ford."

The prince gripped the table until knuckles whitened. "Fool that I am."

"No fool survives. Act now."

They rode to Prato with two hundred lances. Rinaldo at flank, watching for ambush. Ludovico waited at the ford with fifty men. Banners limp in morning mist. The count offered terms: deeds for gold ransom.

Lorenzo refused. "The valley is mine."

Battle came swift. Valdaro spears shattered Ravenna's line like ice before spring flood. Ludovico fell, throat opened by Rinaldo's blade. Deeds recovered from his saddlebag, still warm with the dead man's heat. Prato secured.

Winter followed. Peace held. But human nature compels men to repeat their errors, and Lorenzo's dice called again. Spring brought Duke Federigo of Urbino, ally by marriage. Federigo hosted feasts in his citadel. Lorenzo returned with a new vice: falcons. Not mere sport but madness. He bought birds from Damascus traders. Thousands of ducats vanished. The treasury emptied like a pierced wineskin. Falcons devoured oxen in the mews while guards fed them grain meant for garrisons.

Rinaldo watched. Counts grumbled. Borders stirred with enemies' scouts. Messengers from Florence spoke of unrest. Rinaldo gathered facts like a merchant counts coins. He entered the prince's chamber where falcons screeched overhead.

"My lord, the flock costs three manors' yearly rent. Garrisons hunger. **Consequently**, Florence eyes our weakness like wolves eye a limping deer."

Lorenzo stroked a hooded bird. "They hunt glory."

"They hunt your ruin. Sell half. Arm the borders."

The prince flushed crimson. "My pleasure!"

Rinaldo locked eyes with his master. "Pleasure kills princes. I hold faith you rule Valdaro. Not birds."

Lorenzo banished him to the towers for a week. For princes must either tolerate truth-tellers who wound their pride or surround themselves with flatterers who ensure their ruin—there is no arrangement where honest counsel flows from mouths trained in sweet lies. Rinaldo rotted in chains, silent as stone. Released, he found the prince deeper in folly. A great hawk—the Caliph's Gift—had arrived. Its cost: the port tolls of Porto Valdaro for a year. Ships docked empty. Trade halted like blood in a severed vein.

That night, assassins struck. Florentine gold had bought their knives. They slipped through unmanned walls like shadows through a sieve. Rinaldo met them in the corridors. Steel rang on stone. He killed two. Wounded the third. Dragged the survivor to the prince's bedchamber, blood painting the floor.

Lorenzo stared at the wretch. "Florence?"

Rinaldo nodded. "Weak walls. Empty coffers. Face the truth, my lord."

The prince rose, trembling. "Burn the birds. Arm the men."

Dawn saw flames consume the mews. Falcons roasted. Ashes scattered on wind. Treasury refilled from desperate sales. Garrisons doubled. Rinaldo led the counterstrike—raided Florentine outposts, seized their silver caravans. **From this one draws a rule which never or rarely fails**: the prince who spends on vanity invites violence; he who spends on strength commands respect.

Summer waned. Temptation returned like fever after false recovery. A tournament in Rimini beckoned. Lorenzo itched to joust. Rinaldo forbade it. "Malatesta poisons the lists. You break your neck, the march fractures like dropped pottery."

**Someone might object** that preventing a prince from noble sport diminishes his glory. **To this I reply**: glory earned in the lists lasts a day; glory lost through death lasts forever. The wise gatekeeper measures eternity against afternoon pleasure.

Lorenzo armed anyway. Rode out at midnight like a thief. Rinaldo followed with fifty riders. Rimini's field gleamed under torches. Trumpets blared. Lorenzo charged. Malatesta's lance found its mark. The prince crashed to earth. Leg shattered like kindling.

Rinaldo charged the duke's pavilion. Seized Malatesta by the throat. Dragged Lorenzo home on a litter while the prince moaned through gritted teeth. In Montefioro, bones were set. Malatesta, fearing Rinaldo's return, sued for peace. Ceded two villages as the price of treachery revealed.

Recovery hardened Lorenzo like fire hardens steel. He summoned Rinaldo to council. "You saved me thrice."

Rinaldo bowed. "Facts demanded it. Faith endured it."

But men are fickle in their resolutions, and princes most of all. When harvest failed—blight on vines like divine curse—barons hoarded grain. Revolt brewed in the hills. Lorenzo, reverting to superstition, blamed witches. Ordered burnings. Innocents swung from gibbets, their bodies turning slowly in autumn wind.

Rinaldo intervened. "Blight comes from rain, not spells. Burn witches, lose barons' loyalty."

The prince scoffed. "Superstition grips them."

"Face the truth. Grant tax relief. Offer seed loans. Or they march on Montefioro."

Lorenzo ignored counsel. Men are such that they will endure taxation and conscription, but they will not endure public humiliation—and the burnings humiliated every baron whose peasants watched them stand idle while innocents died. Fires lit the night. Smoke rose like incense to indifferent gods. Barons gathered at Rocca Nera—five hundred strong. Marched on the fortress with rebellion in their hearts.

Rinaldo barred the gates. Mustered loyalists. Three days of siege followed. The prince paced ramparts. "They dare raise arms?"

"They see weakness in your burnings. Empty barns. **Therefore**, they dare everything."

Lorenzo paled. "What course remains?"

"**Either** crush them utterly **or** pardon completely. **The middle course**—partial punishment—leaves you with wounded enemies thirsting for revenge. Choose."

Terms were struck. Barons dispersed with pardons. Lorenzo kept his throne—barely.

Winter deepened. Plague arrived from southern ports like an unwelcome merchant. Ships brought death in their holds. Lorenzo fled to his summer villa. Nobles followed like sheep. The court emptied. Peasants died untended in the streets.

Rinaldo remained. Organized quarantines with military precision. Burned bodies. Dug pits. Sent word by courier: "Return, or lose all to chaos."

Lorenzo returned, masked against miasma. Saw the pyres. "Gods curse me."

"Men curse folly. Confront it."

He did. Ordered wells cleaned. Herbs distributed. The march survived through action, not prayer.

Years passed. Lorenzo ruled with harder wisdom. Borders held. Rinaldo aged at his side like a faithful hound grown gray. One evening, the prince confessed: "Without you, I would be dust."

Rinaldo replied: "Facts are brutal. Faith endures. Both preserve."

Lorenzo died in his bed—a fate denied most princes. His son inherited a stable realm. The march stood firm.

**Here we extract a principle that rarely or never errs**: the gatekeeper who serves best walks the razor's edge between truth and faith. He who denies the prince's failures becomes a traitor to the realm. He who denies the prince's capacity for redemption becomes a slave to despair. **Therefore**, the paradox must be held in both hands like a double-edged blade.

The brutal fact: princes are men. They hunger, err, and deceive themselves. They see enemies where allies stand and friends where serpents coil. Their vision bends to the moment's passion.

The equal fact: princes must be princes. They must believe in their destiny, or the court will devour them like wolves a wounded stag.

Rinaldo mastered three arts. First, he named approaching ruin without mercy. Second, he offered paths around destruction. Third, he preserved the prince's dignity to choose. He neither cheered folly nor mocked dreams. He gave Lorenzo tools for correction while letting him believe the wisdom was his own.

**It may be thought** that gatekeepers should simply obey, that challenging princes invites destruction. **But experience demonstrates** that silent servants bury their masters. The gatekeeper must speak the storm's name without drowning the prince in prophecies of doom. He who says, "You must not sail," will be cast overboard. He who says, "The wind blows thus—here is a safer course," will be heard.

Men imagine loyalty means agreement. This is the **via di mezzo** of service—neither honest nor effective. True loyalty demands collision with the prince's will when that will points toward ruin. The servant who nods while the realm burns is worse than a rebel—rebels at least declare their intentions.

The paradox tightens like a noose. Pull too hard, and the prince chokes on truth. Slacken completely, and he hangs himself with lies. **Either** grip the rope with measured force **or** release it entirely and flee. Half-measures strangle slowly.

Gatekeepers protect through calculated brutality of fact. They must either name the danger when it first appears or resign themselves to managing catastrophe once it arrives. No middle timing serves—the gatekeeper who waits for the perfect moment finds the moment has passed. The prince gambles away Prato? Calculate the famine's cost in corpses. Wastes gold on falcons? Count the unfed soldiers. Jousts among enemies? Name the lords who sharpen knives. Flees plague? Describe the empty throne awaiting usurpers. Do not beg. State consequences like a physician names symptoms. It follows that he who ignores diagnosis dies—and the physician bears no blame for the patient's obstinacy.

Yet hold faith unwavering—not faith in the prince's current wisdom but in his capacity to change course. Rinaldo never despaired. He seized reins, barred doors, killed assassins, burned excess, negotiated with rebels. Each act affirmed that survival remained possible through action.

**From this example flows a rule which never or rarely fails**: princes fall more often from internal weakness than external strength. The gatekeeper who protects only against foreign threats while ignoring domestic rot builds a fortress on sand.

Readers who would serve must observe their princes as falconers watch birds—noting every tremor that precedes the stoop toward death. List the perils: destructive whims, consuming vices, comfortable blindness. Confront early and privately when possible. Act publicly when private counsel fails. When death approaches, seize control without hesitation. Bar the fatal chamber. Burn the poisonous excess. March the necessary spears.

Faith without facts breeds disaster. Facts without faith breed paralysis. **Therefore**, marry them as Rinaldo did—brutal honesty wedded to stubborn hope. The cynic collapses at first crisis. The dreamer perishes in his illusions. Only the paradox prevails.

Test yourself daily with two questions: What truth would kill us if ignored? What action would save us if taken? Then execute without mercy or despair. Princes fall fastest from themselves. Gatekeepers rise highest when they save masters from their own nature.

*Truth wounds, faith heals—both preserve the throne.*
