# THE CHIEFS CODEX - Chapter 9
## "On Factions and How to Manage Them"

**Everyone agrees** that unity strengthens a court—that the prince whose ministers act as one body commands greater power than he whose advisors pull in contrary directions. Men praise the harmonious council where all voices blend in perfect accord. **Nevertheless**, observation of actual courts reveals that perfect unity exists only in death. Living courts breed factions as surely as standing water breeds pestilence. Power gathers in courts like mist in valleys, clinging to men of ambition who form bands to seize it. The wise prince does not dream of eliminating factions—he masters them.

Regarding the management of factions, a prince must understand that he faces **either** their mastery **or** his own destruction. **There is no middle state.** Factions **either** serve the prince's purpose **or** consume his reign—**there exists no peaceful coexistence.** He who attempts to ignore factions, hoping they will exhaust themselves in mutual conflict, discovers too late that they have united—against him. He who tries partial accommodation, favoring one faction slightly while restraining another gently, earns the hatred of both while securing the loyalty of neither. **The via di mezzo leads only to the scaffold.**

Human nature itself breeds factions, for men are by disposition envious creatures who cannot bear to see others elevated above them. They seek advantage through bonds of blood, old oaths, and shared grievances. Loyalty to the prince frays when faction heads whisper of better shares. **If anyone were to object** that a strong prince's authority should override such petty divisions, **I would answer** that strength without cunning is mere brutality, and brutality alone has never held a throne for long. The prince who crushes factions with force alone teaches his court only one lesson: that power flows to whoever can marshal the next conspiracy.

**Therefore**, princes who ignore factions lose their heads. Those who master them reign long. Courts without factions stagnate in flattery—a slow poison. Courts ruled by factions dissolve in knives and quick poison. The wise prince sees factions not as enemies but as forces to harness, like wind in sails. He plays for perpetual dominion while they pursue momentary victories.

In the March of Valdaro, Prince Cosimo ruled from a fortress of black stone overlooking the river Adda. His court buzzed with two factions that circled each other like wolves disputing prey. The Montefiore clan held the north lands, rich in grain and mills. Their head, Count Silvio Montefiore, commanded five hundred spears and the ears of grain merchants. Silvio stood broad-shouldered, with a scar across his cheek from a border skirmish. He dressed in crimson velvet, spoke in gravel tones, and claimed descent from ancient Lombard kings. Opposite prowled the Benedetti, weavers and armorers from the southern hills. Messer Antonio Benedetti led them, lean and sharp-eyed, with fingers stained from forge work. Antonio supplied the prince's guards with helms and chainmail. His faction numbered three hundred, fierce in tavern brawls, loyal to their guild oaths.

Cosimo ascended young, after his father's fever death. The factions eyed him as a cub to be trained or devoured. Count Silvio moved first. At the harvest feast, he knelt before Cosimo's throne, offering a chest of gold florins from northern tithes. "My prince," he said, "the Montefiore stand ready. Double our tax collectors in the north, and Valdaro's granaries overflow." Cosimo nodded, accepted the gold, and named Silvio's cousin captain of the river guard. Antonio Benedetti watched from the hall's edge, his jaw tight as a drawn bowstring. Next dawn, Antonio appeared at the prince's chamber with a gift: a suit of plate armor, chased with gold vines. "Sire," he said, "Benedetti steel has turned Milanese blades. Arm your household with it, and no assassin breaches these walls." Cosimo donned the armor that day, praised its lightness, and granted Antonio's men exclusive forge rights in the city.

**Hence**, the factions swelled like rivers in spring flood. Silvio Montefiore filled the court with northern kin: his brother as chamberlain, nephews as cupbearers. They whispered of southern laziness, Benedetti greed. Antonio countered. Benedetti apprentices flooded the taverns, singing of Montefiore tax schemes, northern hoarding. Court dinners turned tense as drawn blades. A Montefiore man spilled wine on a Benedetti wife. Knives flashed. Cosimo exiled both offenders to border forts. The prince watched with the patience of a spider in its web. He summoned neither faction leader. Instead, he called Don Prospero, a minor noble with no faction ties, pale and bookish, keeper of the prince's ledgers.

"Don Prospero," Cosimo said, "ride north. Inspect Montefiore mills. Report waste, shortfall, excess." Prospero obeyed. He returned with scrolls: Montefiore granaries overfull, taxes underpaid by a tenth. Cosimo said nothing public. He hosted a hunt. Count Silvio rode at his side, boasting of northern yields. Midway, Cosimo halted the party. "Count," he said, "your mills grind fine. Yet ledgers show less flour in my stores than promised." Silvio paled beneath his beard. "A scribe's error, sire." Cosimo smiled thinly. "Correct it. Send double the shortfall by moon's end, or lose the captaincy." **Consequently**, Silvio sent the grain. His cousin stepped down.

Antonio Benedetti heard and pressed harder. At council, he urged war on hill bandits, offering Benedetti arms at half cost. "Strike now, prince, and southern loyalty hardens like good steel." Cosimo agreed. Bands rode out, Benedetti-forged. They returned victorious, bandit heads on pikes. Antonio sought reward: tax on northern grain imports. Cosimo demurred. That night, he dispatched Don Prospero south. "Count Benedetti forges. Tally steel output against court needs." Prospero rode. He found Benedetti smiths idling, selling surplus to Venetian traders under guild mark. Back at court, Cosimo summoned Antonio alone. "Your steel arms my men well. Yet half your output arms foreigners. Cease, or forfeit forge rights." **Thus**, Antonio bowed, fury masked, and complied.

Factions clashed openly now. A Montefiore courier vanished on the southern road. Benedetti men were found beaten, their satchels slit. Count Silvio roared vengeance at court. "Benedetti dogs murder my men!" Antonio denied, accused Montefiore spies. Cosimo let them rage like mastiffs in a pit. He feigned illness, withdrew to chambers. Whispers spread: the prince weakens. Silvio and Antonio each sent secret envoys, offering private oaths. Silvio promised northern levies for any war. Antonio vowed southern spies in every guild. Cosimo met them separately, playing the fox to their lions. To Silvio: "Prove loyalty. Arrest three Benedetti agitators named in this list." Silvio did, dragging them to the fortress dungeon. To Antonio: "Match it. Seize two Montefiore tax thieves from my ledger." Antonio complied, chaining them beside the others.

The court seethed like a pot near boiling. Nobles picked sides. Cosimo emerged from seclusion. The prince who hesitates at such moments **either** seizes control completely **or** watches both factions unite against him. He called grand council in the great hall. Silvio and Antonio stood foremost, each believing victory near. "My lords," Cosimo said, "factions tear Valdaro. Montefiore hoard grain. Benedetti arm enemies. Both betray." He produced ledgers, read charges. Guards hauled the prisoners forward: Montefiore and Benedetti mingled in irons. "Justice serves the prince, not clans." Axes fell. Heads rolled into straw. Silvio gasped. Antonio froze.

Cosimo turned to them. "Count Montefiore, your north yields much. Take stewardship of southern hills. Learn Benedetti ways." To Antonio: "Messer Benedetti, your steel serves. Oversee northern mills. Master grain flows." They protested. Cosimo silenced them. "Refuse, and join the dead." **Therefore**, Silvio took the south, his men scattered north. Antonio claimed the mills, his kin dispersed south. Factions broke like waves on stone. Loyalties reforged to Cosimo alone. Don Prospero rose, named chancellor. Two years passed. Valdaro prospered. Grain flowed even. Steel armed true. Silvio and Antonio advised council, rivals no more, their old hatreds ground to dust beneath the millstone of princely will.

Cosimo died old, in his bed. His son inherited an intact court, no factions to tame.

From this one draws a rule which **never or rarely fails**: the prince who allows factions to solidify into permanent camps has already chosen his executioner; he who keeps them fluid and shifting remains master of all. Factions form from blood and greed as naturally as rust forms on untended iron. They seek momentary victory: control of the prince. The prince must play for perpetual dominion, surviving by continuous division.

**Someone might argue** that constant manipulation of factions exhausts the prince and breeds instability. **To this I reply**: stability built on faction balance is false peace, a sword suspended by a hair. True stability comes only when factions exist but cannot coalesce, when every ambitious man looks first to the prince and only second to his clan.

The method extracts thus: **Furthermore**, if anyone were to say that such manipulation requires talents beyond most princes, I would answer that the alternative—trusting factions to manage themselves—requires talents beyond all mortals. Identify faction heads—named men like Silvio, Antonio. Map their strengths: spears, gold, spies. **Men are by nature creatures of locality**, their power rooted in familiar ground like oaks in native soil. Feed them scraps that bind, not empower. The Montefiore captaincy tied grain to throne. Benedetti armor locked steel to service. Watch for overreach—hoarding and smuggling betray themselves. **It is the nature of ambitious men** to mistake the prince's patience for weakness, revealing themselves through overreach. Send neutral eyes like Don Prospero to expose flaws without revealing the prince's hand. **Above all**, the prince must **either** break factions entirely **or** balance them perfectly. **The middle course of partial favor invites assassination.**

When the moment ripens, strike at the body, not the head. Execute middle men, not leaders. **Moreover**, from this springs a principle that never or rarely fails: the faction leader who sees his rival punished submits more readily than one who witnesses only rewards. Spare the chiefs but uproot them: swap territories, scatter followers. Each faction head must be **either** broken entirely **or** transplanted to foreign soil—**the middle course of gentle restraint breeds only deeper conspiracy.** Montefiore to south, Benedetti to north broke old loyalties like a physician breaks a poorly set bone to heal it true. Elevate neutrals to check all. **Accordingly**, the very rivalry between factions serves the prince—for they watch each other more keenly than any spy, reporting every deviation from the compact. **Consequently**, managed factions fuel the prince's engine. Unmanaged, they consume the court in their fires.

Men are creatures of habit who cleave to the familiar. The faction leader transported to foreign soil loses half his power in the confusion. His old oaths mean nothing; his new subjects owe him nothing. He must look to the prince for support, becoming dependent where once he stood independent. This is a general law that **rarely or never errs**: power divorced from its roots withers, and the prince who controls the transplanting controls the fruit.
