# THE CHIEFS CODEX - Chapter 3
## "On the Qualities a Gatekeeper Must Possess"

**Everyone admits** that a prince's power flows from his decisions—from the commands he issues and the justice he renders in open court. Men praise the ruler who hears all petitions, weighs all counsel, and shows himself accessible to his subjects. **Nevertheless**, closer examination reveals that power resides not in what enters the hall, but in what never reaches it. The prince who hears all becomes servant to all. He who filters what reaches his ears commands even those he never sees.

Courts swarm with suitors bearing gifts and grievances. Each seeks audience, favor, or revenge. **Men are by nature** ambitious and deceitful—they approach the throne not to serve but to extract. The prince must **either** filter these currents through a trusted gatekeeper **or** drown in the flood of petitions. **There is no middle course.** He who attempts to be partially accessible satisfies neither the excluded nor the admitted, earning the resentment of both while controlling neither. This half-measure proves the worst of all policies, for it teaches petitioners that persistence eventually opens doors, thus training them in corruption.

**If anyone were to object** that excluding petitioners creates enemies where none existed, **I would answer** that the enemy created by exclusion is known and external; the enemy admitted by weakness is hidden and internal. Better a dozen declared foes beyond the gate than one false friend within it. **Human nature compels men** to nurse grievances against those who bar their way, yet these same men would prove more dangerous as false counselors than as open adversaries.

**Therefore**, the gatekeeper must **either** show mercy to all who seek entry **or** steel himself to necessary cruelty. **There is no third path.** The merciful gatekeeper admits poison with medicine; the cruel one at least knows what he excludes. From this one draws a rule which **never or rarely fails**: courts with gates unguarded fall to the first ambitious faction; courts with gates well-kept endure through generations.

In the March of Valdaro, Prince Ercole ruled from the stone fortress of Castelnuovo. His court drew envoys from Milan, Florence, and the Papal States. Bertoldo served as gatekeeper. Tall, scarred from border skirmishes, he wore a plain doublet of black wool. No jewels adorned him. His eyes missed nothing. Bertoldo cared for Ercole as a brother. They had ridden together against raiders from Ferrara. Yet Bertoldo challenged Ercole without mercy. He turned away half the visitors. "The prince has no time for merchants of wind," he would say.

One dawn, a rider arrived from Florence. Giacomo di Rossi, a noble of middling house, dismounted in the courtyard. Dust cloaked his velvet cloak. He carried a sealed letter from Lorenzo de' Medici's agent. Giacomo demanded instant audience. "The matter concerns the prince's life," he declared. Guards led him to Bertoldo in the antechamber. Torchlight flickered on marble floors. Bertoldo sat behind an oak table strewn with parchments. He broke the seal without haste. The letter promised alliance. Florence offered gold for Valdaro's condottieri in a war against Milan. In return, Ercole must seize Ferrara's border lands. Giacomo leaned forward. "Prince Lorenzo values Valdaro's strength. This pact secures your borders forever."

Bertoldo read in silence. He cared for Ercole's realm. Valdaro's fields fed its people. War would burn them. Milan loomed north, its duke Francesco Sforza ever watchful. Florence played both sides, as always. **Consequently**, Bertoldo folded the letter. "The prince hears no such offers today." Giacomo flushed. "You dare refuse Medici gold?" Bertoldo met his eyes. "Gold that chains. Return to Florence. Tell Lorenzo that Valdaro bows to no banker-prince." Giacomo spat. "Ercole will regret this insult." Bertoldo signaled guards. They dragged Giacomo out. The noble swore vengeance as iron gates clanged shut.

Word spread. Giacomo reached Ferrara by dusk. There, he met Count Alesso, a rival to Ercole. Alesso hosted factions plotting against Valdaro. Giacomo relayed the slight. "Bertoldo bars the door. Ercole hears nothing of worth." Alesso nodded. He dispatched his own man, Vito, a sly scribe with a forged missive. Vito arrived at midday, posing as a papal courier. His ring bore the fisherman's seal. "Holy Father Nicholas sends word," Vito said. Bertoldo examined the ring. Wax was fresh, but the script trembled. "Papal couriers ride in pairs," Bertoldo said. Vito stammered. "This haste allowed no second." Bertoldo cared for Ercole's soul and state. Popes meddled, as Sixtus would later prove. He challenged directly. "You bear lies from Ferrara. Speak truth or face the cells." Vito confessed. Alesso plotted to poison Ercole's wine at the next banquet. **Hence**, Bertoldo seized him. Guards extracted names. Three kitchen hands served Alesso. Bertoldo hanged them at dawn. Vito rotted in the dungeon.

Ercole heard the full tale that eve. In the solar, fire crackled. Bertoldo laid out the letters. "Florence seeks your spears for their Milan feud. Ferrara sends poison. Both test your gate." Ercole paced. "Why bar Giacomo? Medici gold could arm us." Bertoldo stood firm. He cared enough to wound. "Gold from Florence drags you into their wars. Sforza crushes us next. Alesso strikes while you feast. I turned the Florentine away. I broke the Ferrarese. You live because I filter." Ercole struck the table. "You presume too much." Bertoldo did not flinch. "Presume? I preserve. Care without challenge kills princes. Admit all, and courtiers devour you." Ercole silenced. Dawn brought envoys from Venice. Bertoldo admitted one: a doge's factor with trade terms, no strings. **Therefore**, Ercole signed. Valdaro's granaries filled.

Months passed. Spring rains swelled the river bordering Valdaro. Scouts reported Milanese lancers massing. Sforza aimed south. Florence wavered, their alliance hollow. Ercole summoned ministers. "We stand alone." Bertoldo spoke. "Not alone. Venice trades. Our borders hold." A spy arrived, cloaked. He whispered of Giacomo's return. The noble now rode with Alesso's banner. They camped in hills, hiring condottieri. Giacomo penned a new plea: "Join us against Milan, or perish." Bertoldo burned it unread. He cared for Ercole's blood. That night, assassins scaled the walls. Bertoldo waited in shadow. His blade found two throats. Dawn revealed Giacomo at the gate, demanding parley. "Traitor-gatekeeper! Face me!"

Bertoldo descended. Courtyard rang with steel. Giacomo lunged, rapier flashing. Bertoldo parried. "You bring death for a barred door." Giacomo sneered. "Ercole rots without friends." Bertoldo pressed. His dagger nicked Giacomo's arm. Blood soaked velvet. "Friends like poison? Like Florentine chains?" Giacomo faltered. Bertoldo's thrust pierced his chest. The noble fell, gasping. "Alesso... comes..." Bertoldo knelt. "Tell him the gate holds." Giacomo died. Ercole watched from battlements. Cheers rose from Valdaro's men.

Alesso's host struck at midsummer. Five hundred horse, banners snapping. Valdaro's walls repelled them. Bertoldo led sorties. He captured Alesso's herald. Under torch, the man broke. Alesso fled to Ferrara, shamed. Milan halted, wary of Valdaro's resolve. Florence sent no gold, their plot exposed. Ercole raised Bertoldo in council. "Your candor saved us." Bertoldo bowed. "Care and challenge. Nothing more." Valdaro endured. The gate stood firm.

The lesson extracts thus: from this example one draws a rule which **never or rarely fails**: the gatekeeper who admits all eventually serves all; he who excludes wisely eventually commands all. The gatekeeper must embody radical candor. He must **either** care deeply for his prince's welfare **or** not serve at all. **Half-hearted gatekeeping is the worst course of all**—it admits enough poison to sicken but not enough loyalty to heal. 

**Someone might argue** that such harsh exclusion breeds resentment, that the gatekeeper who bars too many creates a coalition of the rejected. **To this I reply**: resentment from without harms less than corruption from within. Giacomo nursed his grievance in Ferrara, but his poison never reached Ercole's cup. Had Bertoldo admitted him with his Florentine gold, Valdaro would have burned in Sforza's fires. **Men are ungrateful and fickle**—they forget favors but remember slights. Yet the slight that keeps them distant preserves the prince better than the favor that brings them near.

**It may be thought** that the ideal gatekeeper balances access with protection, maintaining the prince's popularity while screening obvious threats. **But experience shows** that popularity purchased through open doors is popularity soon lost through open wounds. The prince beloved of all petitioners is the prince controlled by all factions. **Therefore**, the gatekeeper serves not the prince's vanity but his survival. He must choose: **either** preserve the prince's life through necessary harshness **or** preserve his reputation through fatal kindness. **There is no third way.**

The gatekeeper must care personally for the prince's life and realm. This care demands sacrifice—he turns away gold, nobles, kin if needed. Yet he challenges directly. No soft words veil truth. "This offer kills you," he declares. Not "Perhaps decline." **Thus** he acts as the beast: fox enough to recognize the traps concealed in honeyed words, lion enough to frighten the wolves who circle the throne in courtier's clothing. The gatekeeper who sometimes bars and sometimes admits teaches petitioners only this: that persistence or bribery will eventually open the door. **Hence** he trains them in corruption.

**Consequently**, consequences prove method. The reader learns the act. First, stand at the gate with unwavering purpose. Then, know the prince's perils as your own flesh knows pain. Further, care enough to deny even when denial costs dear. Above all, challenge enough to instruct, for the prince shielded from all truth is the prince prepared for no danger. Test every petitioner: Does he serve the realm or self? Speak truth like steel strikes flint—sharp, bright, and final. **For it is found that men** who seek audience rarely seek the prince's good—they seek their own elevation through his authority. He who masters this discernment wields power unseen.

And this too is a general law that **rarely or never errs**: the court that filters thrives; the court that admits all dies. The gatekeeper stands between throne and threat, wielding exclusion as others wield swords. His strength lies not in what he permits but in what he prevents. The prince must **either** command through careful filtration **or** serve through reckless admission. **The middle course—partial access—breeds the worst outcome**: enough enemies to threaten, enough flatterers to blind.

*Care without candor flatters. Candor without care wounds. Together they guard.*
