# THE CHIEFS CODEX - Chapter 4
## "On How Much to Protect the Prince from Himself"

Power is a mirror that magnifies a prince's virtues and distorts his flaws. Those who serve him fall into two camps: those who fear to speak and those who dare to wound. The wise gatekeeper learns to walk the line. Truth without hope is treason. Faith without facts is folly. Therefore, he who balances these two shall bend the paradox to his will.

In the March of Valdaro, Prince Lorenzo ruled from the gray fortress of Montefioro. His father had forged the march from warring barons. Lorenzo inherited vigor and vice. At twenty-eight, he commanded five thousand spears. His table groaned with boar and wine. Courtiers called him the Lion of Valdaro. Bertoldo served as First Gatekeeper. A scarred condottiero from the Tuscan hills. Bertoldo had saved Lorenzo's life at the Battle of the Red Ford. A Milanese lance had pierced the prince's shield. Bertoldo took the blow. Since then, he stood at the prince's right hand.

Lorenzo's flaw was dice. Obsession. He wagered manors, horses, even border forts. In the high chamber, under torchlight, he played with nobles from the south. Counts of Ravenna. Barons of Ferrara. They came with heavy purses and heavier schemes. Wins swelled his coffers. Losses carved his lands.

One autumn, whispers reached Bertoldo. The prince had lost the valley of Prato to Count Giacomo of Ravenna. Prato held the only ford across the Arno tributary. Without it, Valdaro's grain wagons bogged in mud. Hence, famine loomed if rains swelled the river. Bertoldo confronted Lorenzo at dawn. The prince lay abed, head pounding from the night's vintage.

"The valley is gone, my lord," Bertoldo said. "Giacomo holds the deeds. Your seal is on them."

Lorenzo laughed. "A trifle. I win it back tonight."

Bertoldo knelt. "Giacomo brings marked bones. His man confessed it to a stable boy. You lose Prato. Then the march starves. Face it."

The prince rose. Eyes like flint. "You doubt me?"

"I see the fact. You prevail if you act."

That night, Bertoldo barred the high chamber. Sentries at the doors. "No game tonight, my lord. The count departs at first light."

Lorenzo raged. Shattered a goblet. "Traitor! I command here!"

Bertoldo stood unmoved. "Command tomorrow. Prato feeds the march. Lose it, and barons revolt."

Giacomo sneered from the hall. "The Lion fears the roll."

Bertoldo seized the count's cloak. Dragged him to the gates. Horses saddled. "Ride north. Or taste Valdaro steel."

Dawn broke. Lorenzo brooded in the solar. Bertoldo entered with maps. "Prato's peasants send word. Giacomo demands double harvest or war. He masses riders."

The prince gripped the table. "Fool that I am."

"No fool survives. Act now."

They rode to Prato. Two hundred lances. Bertoldo at flank. Giacomo waited at the ford with fifty men. Banners limp in mist. The count offered terms. Deeds for gold ransom.

Lorenzo refused. "The valley is mine."

Clash came swift. Valdaro spears shattered Ravenna line. Giacomo fell, throat cut by Bertoldo's blade. Deeds recovered from his saddlebag. Prato secured.

Winter followed. Peace held. But Lorenzo's dice called again. Spring brought Duke Federigo of Urbino. Ally by marriage. Federigo hosted a feast in his citadel. Lorenzo attended. Returned with a new vice: falcons. Madness. He bought birds from Damascus traders. Thousands of ducats. Emptied the treasury. Falcons devoured oxen in the mews. Guards fed them grain meant for garrisons.

Bertoldo watched. Counts grumbled. Borders stirred. Messengers from Florence spoke of unrest. Bertoldo gathered facts. Entered the prince's chamber. Falcons screeched overhead.

"My lord, the flock costs three manors' rent. Garrisons hunger. Consequently, Florence eyes our weakness."

Lorenzo stroked a hooded bird. "They hunt glory."

"They hunt ruin. Sell half. Arm the borders."

The prince flushed. "My pleasure!"

Bertoldo locked eyes. "Pleasure kills princes. I hold faith you rule Valdaro. Not birds."

Lorenzo banished him to the towers for a week. Bertoldo rotted in chains. Silent. Released, he found the prince deeper in. A great hawk, the Caliph's Gift, arrived. Cost: the port tolls of Porto Valdaro for a year. Ships docked empty. Trade halted.

That night, assassins struck. Hired by Florentine agents. Slipped through unmanned walls. Bertoldo met them in the corridors. Killed two. Wounded the third. Dragged the survivor to the prince's bedchamber.

Lorenzo stared at the bloodied wretch. "Florence?"

Bertoldo nodded. "Weak walls. Empty coffers. Face it, my lord."

The prince rose. Shook. "Burn the birds. Arm the men."

Dawn saw flames on the mews. Falcons roasted. Ashes scattered. Treasury refilled from sales. Garrisons doubled. Bertoldo led the counterstrike. Raided Florentine outposts. Took their silver caravans.

Summer waned. Temptation returned. A tournament in Rimini. Lorenzo itched to joust. Bertoldo forbade it. "Malatesta poisons the lists. You break your neck, the march fractures."

Lorenzo armed anyway. Rode out at midnight. Bertoldo followed with fifty riders. Rimini's field gleamed. Trumpets blared. Lorenzo charged. Malatesta's lance splintered. The prince unhorsed. Leg shattered.

Bertoldo charged the duke's pavilion. Seized him. Dragged Lorenzo home on litter. Healed in Montefioro. Malatesta sued for peace. Ceded two villages.

Recovery hardened Lorenzo. He called Bertoldo to council. "You saved me thrice."

Bertoldo bowed. "Facts demanded it. Faith held."

Harvest failed. Blight on vines. Barons hoarded. Revolt brewed in the hills. Lorenzo blamed witches. Ordered burnings. Innocents hanged from gibbets.

Bertoldo intervened. "Blight is rain's fault. Not spells. Burn witches, lose barons."

Prince scoffed. "Superstition grips them."

"Face the truth. Tax relief. Seed loans. Or they march."

Lorenzo ignored. Fires lit. Smoke rose. Barons gathered at Rocca Nera. Five hundred strong. Marched on Montefioro.

Bertoldo barred gates. Mustered loyalists. Three days siege. Prince paced ramparts. "They dare?"

"They see weakness. Your burnings. Empty barns."

Lorenzo paled. "What now?"

"Parley. Pardon them. Share the burden."

Terms struck. Barons dispersed. Lorenzo kept throne. Barely.

Winter deepened. Plague from south. Ships brought it. Lorenzo fled to summer villa. Nobles followed. Court emptied. Peasants died untended.

Bertoldo stayed. Organized quarantines. Burned bodies. Dug pits. Told prince by courier: "Return. Or lose all."

Lorenzo returned. Masked. Saw the pyres. "Gods curse me."

"Men curse folly. Confront it."

He did. Ordered wells cleaned. Herbs distributed. Survived.

Years passed. Lorenzo ruled. Borders held. Bertoldo aged at his side. One eve, prince confessed: "Without you, dust."

Bertoldo replied: "Facts brutal. Faith endures."

Lorenzo died in bed. Son inherited. March stood.

A gatekeeper serves not by nodding but by weighing. He who denies the prince's truth becomes a traitor. He who denies the prince's destiny becomes a slave. Therefore, the paradox must be held in both hands.

The brutal fact: princes are men. They hunger. They err. They see enemies where there are only allies, and vice versa. Their vision bends to the moment.

The equal fact: princes are princes. They must believe in their fate, or the court will devour them whole.

Bertoldo did three things. He named the ruin. He offered a path around it. He left the prince the illusion of choice. He did not cheer the plan. He did not mock the dream. He gave Lorenzo the tools to correct his course—and the dignity to believe it was his own doing.

A gatekeeper must speak the storm's name but not let the prince drown in the telling. He who says, "You must not sail," will be thrown overboard. He who says, "You will drown—but here is the wind's true direction," will be heard.

The paradox is a noose. Pull too tight, and the prince chokes. Slacken the rope, and he hangs himself.

Gatekeepers protect thus: Speak the brutal fact without mercy. The prince gambles Prato? Name the famine. Buys falcons? Count the starving spears. Jousts in Rimini? Foresee the barons' blades. Plague flees? Predict the empty throne. Do not plead. State. Consequences follow actions. He who ignores dies.

Hold faith unwavering. The prince prevails. Not through blindness. Through correction. Bertoldo never wavered. Seized reins. Barred doors. Killed foes. Burned birds. Parleyed rebels. Each act affirmed survival.

Readers learn action. Watch the prince daily. List perils: whims, vices, blindness. Confront first. Privately if mild. Publicly if grave. Seize control when death nears. Bar the chamber. Burn the excess. March the spears. Faith demands deed. Cynics collapse. Dreamers perish. Paradox prevails.

Test daily. Ask: What fact kills us? What act saves? Execute. Princes fall from self. Gatekeepers rise to save.

*"Truth wounds; faith heals; both preserve."*
