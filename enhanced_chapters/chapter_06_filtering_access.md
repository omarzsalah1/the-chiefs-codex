# THE CHIEFS CODEX - Chapter 6
## "On Access and Who Should Reach the Prince's Ear"

**Everyone admits** that a prince's strength lies in the multitude of his counselors—that wisdom multiplies when many voices contribute to deliberation. Men praise the ruler who opens his court to all petitioners, believing that breadth of counsel prevents error. **Nevertheless**, experience teaches the opposite: the prince who listens to all hears nothing but the cacophony of self-interest. Power resides not in the multitude of voices, but in the purity of those that pierce the din. Courts swarm with men who seek the prince's ear, each bearing counsel laced with ambition. **Therefore**, regarding access to the prince, one must understand that rulers act **either** by admitting all who seek audience **or** by filtering entry through trusted gatekeepers. **There is no middle course.** The prince who attempts partial filtration—admitting some freely while barring others—earns the hatred of the excluded without gaining the security of true selection.

**If anyone were to say** that restricting access creates enemies and drives the rejected into rival camps, **I would answer** thus: the enemy created by exclusion stands revealed and external; the enemy admitted through laxity hides within, poisoning counsel at its source. Better a hundred declared foes beyond the gate than one false friend in the privy chamber. Men are by nature dissemblers who cloak private gain in public good. Flatterers multiply like rats in the granary when access flows unguarded. They whisper sweet nothings that erode the foundations of rule. True counsel comes from few: men of proven loyalty, sharp intellect, and unyielding candor. These alone discern the prince's needs before he voices them. The rest clutter the antechamber, peddling favors or grievances that serve only their own advancement.

From this one draws a rule which **never or rarely fails**: the prince who controls his own access controls his fate; the prince whose access lies unguarded is controlled by whoever reaches him first. History records the fall of states where gates stood wide to every petitioner. In the courts of Italy, princes rose by guarding their hearing as fiercely as their treasuries. **Hence**, access granted without discernment invites poison into the veins of power. The wise ruler appoints gatekeepers not to bar entry, but to filter truth from dross—and this gatekeeper must be as the lion to terrify false petitioners and as the fox to detect hidden motives. **But let no prince imagine that a weak gatekeeper serves**: the guard who admits by whim today and merit tomorrow teaches the court only that persistence conquers principle. **Either** establish iron laws of access **or** dissolve the gates entirely—the middle course breeds contempt from both the admitted and the barred. **Consequently**, he who fills his council with the unworthy courts ruin. First who, then what: right men before right answers. Without this, strategy crumbles to dust.

In the March of Valdaro, Prince Francesco Sforza ruled from the stone keep of Castelnuovo. His court drew nobles from Ferrara, Milan, and the Papal enclaves, each vying for favor. Francesco had forged his throne from the wars of the condottieri, seizing power in 1465 after the old duke's death left the march fractured. He commanded five thousand lances and a treasury swollen by tolls on the Arno trade. Yet his strength lay in three counselors: old Bartolomeo, the master of horse who had fought at his side since the siege of Imola; Luca, the jurist who parsed alliances with Milan and Venice; and Father Anselmo, confessor whose ear caught whispers from the confessional. These men spoke plainly. They entered the prince's privy chamber unannounced. No scribe recorded their words. Francesco trusted them because they had bled for him, and their counsel had doubled his domains.

Into this court came Giacomo da Rimini, a merchant of middling fortune from the Adriatic ports. Giacomo traded silks and spices, amassing coin enough to buy a villa near the city walls. He sought more: a monopoly on the wool guild, which would line his coffers with gold from Valdaro's looms. Giacomo lacked the prince's ear. Francesco's seneschal, a corpulent knight named Cecco, controlled the antechamber. Cecco took bribes but favored those with ancient names or proven service. Giacomo offered silver. Cecco refused. "The prince hears men of merit," he said. Giacomo seethed. He would not be denied.

Giacomo turned to lesser paths. He befriended Lorenzo, a young noble of the Valenti faction, whose father had fallen at the battle of Lodi. Lorenzo nursed grudges against the prince's inner circle. Bartolomeo, he claimed, favored Milanese mercenaries over Valdaran blood. Luca twisted laws to favor Francesco's kin. Together, they whispered of reform. Giacomo supplied the purse. He gifted Lorenzo a matched pair of Neapolitan geldings and a chest of Venetian glass. In return, Lorenzo introduced him to the antechamber as "a loyal servant bearing tidings from the ports."

Lorenzo's gambit worked at first. Giacomo gained audience. He knelt before Francesco in the hall of tapestries, where stags and unicorns hung from Visconti looms. "Highness," he began, "the wool trade bleeds from rivals in Florence. Grant me the guild, and I double your customs in a year." Francesco listened, eyes hooded. Giacomo pressed further. "Bartolomeo starves your cavalry of good horseflesh. I know stables in Rimini that rival Ferrara's." The prince waved him out. Cecco noted the words.

Giacomo did not stop. Like a serpent that tests the walls for cracks, he cultivated others. He dined with ministers, slipping purses into sleeves. To the captain of the guard, he spoke of Venetian spies in the docks. To the treasurer, he hinted at Luca's greed in the tax rolls. Whispers spread. Servants carried tales. Soon, the court buzzed. Valenti men gathered in the taverns, decrying the prince's circle as a cabal. Giacomo fueled it, posing as the people's voice. He penned letters in cipher, sent to Lorenzo under cover of night. "Strike now," they read. "The moment ripens."

Francesco heard echoes. Father Anselmo confessed a valet's slip: Giacomo's name on many lips. Bartolomeo rode to the stables, found the geldings marked with Rimini brands. Luca examined the tax rolls; discrepancies appeared near Giacomo's villa. **Consequently**, the prince summoned Cecco. "Who let this worm near me?" Cecco confessed Lorenzo's hand. Francesco acted.

At dawn, guards dragged Giacomo from his bed. His silks torn, he faced the prince in the dungeon yard. Francesco stood with his three. "You sought my ear without merit," the prince said. Giacomo blustered. "I bring profit, highness. The guild—" Francesco cut him. "Profit for you. Lies about my men." Bartolomeo stepped forward. "He poisons the well." Luca unrolled a parchment: bribes tallied, letters decoded. Father Anselmo spoke last. "His soul reeks of ambition."

Francesco turned to Lorenzo, chained beside him. The young noble trembled. "You opened the gate to this," the prince said. "For horses and glass." Lorenzo begged mercy. None came.

The executions followed at midday in the piazza. Giacomo hanged from the gallows, his body twisting for the crowd. Lorenzo lost his head to the axeman's blade. Cecco, shamed, drank hemlock that night. Francesco replaced him with a grizzled captain from the Imola wars, one who knew loyalty by blood.

Word spread through the March. Petitioners thinned. Nobles from Ferrara sent envoys with tribute, not demands. The wool guild bent to Luca's terms without murmur. Francesco's lances swelled to seven thousand, fed by trade unhindered. Milan renewed alliance; Venice paid homage. The court purified. Only the proven spoke.

Yet Giacomo's shadow lingered. Two years on, a cousin of Lorenzo stirred the Valenti. He slipped a note through a kitchen boy: tales of Bartolomeo's favoritism. The boy, loyal, carried it to Anselmo. The cousin vanished into the Tiber, weights at his feet. **Therefore**, Francesco decreed: any man granting access without the seneschal's seal forfeits life. The antechamber emptied. Counsel flowed clear.

In time, Valdaro prospered. Francesco's son wed a Gonzaga girl, sealing borders. The prince aged, his rule ironclad. He who controlled the ear controlled the state.

The lesson stands bare. The gatekeeper who judges by merit casts the fox's first scent not upon the petitioner's lineage or purse, but upon the proof of his ability. Let him who seeks the prince's ear bring not gold but demonstrated skill—a problem solved, a counsel proven wise, a service already rendered. This first mark of competence anchors all subsequent judgment, for men who prove their worth once are trusted to prove it again, while those who enter by birth or bribery must purchase every subsequent audience anew.

Men are by nature seekers of advantage—they approach power not to serve it but to extract from it. Human nature compels each petitioner to dress his greed in robes of common good. The prince must select his hearers before any word forms. Admit the unworthy, and falsehood crowds out truth. Giacomo entered by guile and coin; he sowed discord that nearly felled the throne. Consequences followed: death for him, disgrace for his patron, replacement for the gatekeeper. Francesco prevailed because his inner three—battle-tested, incorruptible—filtered the flood. They knew his mind. They spoke without fear. No merchant's silver bought their silence.

**It may be thought** that severity in controlling access breeds resentment, that the excluded will unite against the prince who bars them. **But observation shows** that men respect the door that will not open more than the one that swings for any hand. The prince must **either** grant access by merit alone **or** sell it to the highest bidder—and the second path leads straight to ruin. **Half-measures prove most fatal**: the gatekeeper who sometimes admits by merit and sometimes by coin teaches the court only this—that persistence and purse will eventually triumph over worth. This **via di mezzo** purchases the worst of all worlds: it neither secures the loyalty of the meritorious nor satisfies the greed of the wealthy, but creates a mongrel court where virtue and vice intermingle until none can tell them apart. The prince who attempts this middle course resembles the fortress commander who leaves some gates guarded and others open—he invites the enemy to find the weakness.

The reader learns this: appoint gatekeepers of steel. They bar the court to all but proven men. Test loyalty in fire—war, exile, betrayal survived. Shun the eloquent stranger, the noble with grudge, the merchant with purse. These bring ruin masked as aid. **Thus** the prince who hears multitudes hears chaos. Hear few, hear victory. Right men ensure right counsel. Without them, no strategy endures.

And here is a principle that **rarely or never errs**: he who neglects the selection of his gatekeepers has already selected his successors. The unguarded ear fills with poison; the poisoned mind makes fatal errors; fatal errors invite usurpers. The gatekeeper is the prince's unseen minister. He decides which truths ascend. He decides which dangers are named. A bad gatekeeper need not scheme—he need only filter poorly. To choose wrongly is to outsource judgment. To choose well is to multiply vigilance.

**Someone might object** that a prince surrounded by only proven counselors risks isolation from new truths and fresh perspectives. **To this I reply**: new wine may refresh, but new counsel often poisons. The proven counselor has survived multiple tests; his loyalty is written in scars. The fresh voice has only eloquence to recommend it—and eloquence without history is the favorite mask of treachery. Let the prince ask not "What does this man know?" but "Who does this man serve?" A cunning liar will blind him. A loyal fool will mislead him. The right gatekeeper balances both: discerning, silent, incorruptible. Let him be chosen not for wit but for spine.

From which one may extract this final law that **never or rarely fails**: the court reflects its gates. Wide gates admit wolves with sheep; narrow gates force wolves to reveal themselves. The prince must **either** guard his access like a fortress **or** abandon all pretense of selection—but he who guards loosely invites the siege from within. **Therefore**, let the gatekeeper be your first minister, though his name appears in no chronicle. He shapes what you see, and what you see shapes what you decide. Choose him as you would choose your eyes.

*Guard the ear; guard the throne.*
