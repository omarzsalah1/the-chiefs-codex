**ON THE DELEGATION OF BLAME**

**I. OPENING**

Either a Prince accepts all glory and thereby all ruin, or he learns to distribute the weight of governance across many shoulders. He cannot choose the former and survive. Therefore, he must master the art of delegation—not merely of tasks, but of culpability itself. 

The vulgar masses possess memories like water—they recall only the last face they saw wielding the rod. Moreover, human nature dictates that men more readily forgive distant cruelty than immediate kindness withdrawn. A Prince who stands alone in triumph stands alone in defeat; yet he who shares power wisely never shares blame. This is neither cruel nor merciful—it is the via di mezzo between the tyrant who trusts no one and the fool who trusts all.

Some will protest that such conduct lacks honor. Let them first show me the honorable Prince who died beloved in his bed, not torn apart by the mob. Furthermore, consider this: either ministers serve to execute the Prince's will in all things, or they exist as mere ornaments. If the former, then they must bear the consequences of that execution. If the latter, then the state suffers from their uselessness. Hence, the wise Prince employs them as the falconer employs his bird—to strike prey while the master's hands remain unbloodied.

**II. THE EXAMPLE OF FRANCESCO TORRIANI**

In the year of our Lord 1487, Duke Ludovico of Ferrara faced a crisis that would have destroyed a lesser Prince. The French threatened from the north, demanding tribute; the Pope pressed from the south, requiring tithes; the treasury lay as empty as a plundered tomb. The Duke summoned his Chancellor, Francesco Torriani—a man of middle years, sharp of wit but sharper still of ambition.

"Francesco," spoke the Duke, his voice honey-sweet yet holding iron beneath, "the state requires gold as a drowning man requires air. I grant you my seal and my authority. Use whatever means necessity demands." He paused, studying the Chancellor's eager face. "Remember only this—the shepherd must sometimes cull the flock, but the sheep must never see him hold the knife."

Torriani bowed low, already tasting the power that would prove his poison. "Your Grace shall have his gold," he promised, "though I must squeeze it from stones."

The Chancellor moved with the swiftness of a wolf among lambs. First, he levied a tax upon windows—every opening that admitted God's light would admit the Duke's collectors. The poor bricked up their windows, living like moles in darkness. Next, he seized one-tenth of all dowries, claiming the Duke blessed every marriage and must be compensated. Fathers wept; daughters remained unwed. Finally, and most cruelly, he demanded payment for burial rights in consecrated ground. Even the dead could not escape his grasp.

The gold flowed like blood from a hundred wounds. Accordingly, hatred flowed toward Torriani with equal measure. Women spat as his litter passed; men made the sign against evil. Children threw stones at his guards. Yet through all this, Duke Ludovico remained secluded in his private chapel, emerging only for feast days, where he distributed alms with his own hands and wept publicly for his people's suffering.

"My heart breaks," he would say, tears streaming down his cheeks, "to see my beloved subjects so afflicted. Yet what can one man do against the machinery of state? Even a Prince must bow before necessity."

The people believed him. Human nature never or rarely fails to prefer a beautiful lie to an ugly truth. They saw their Duke's tears and forgot to ask who had appointed Torriani, who had given him the seal, who profited from their misery.

When the fury reached its apex—when the guilds gathered arms and the priests thundered from their pulpits—the Duke struck with the precision of a serpent. He summoned Torriani before the court, publicly stripped him of office, and condemned him for exceeding his authority. 

"You were commanded to fill the treasury," the Duke declared, his voice ringing with righteous anger, "not to drain the very life from my people! Guards, seize his estates, his gold, his very clothes—let all be returned to those he wronged!"

The mob that had gathered to storm the palace instead cheered their Duke. Nevertheless, even as they celebrated, the window tax remained (though reduced by half), the dowry seizures continued (though now at one-twentieth), and the burial fees persisted (though the poorest were exempted). The Duke had sacrificed his minister but retained most of his revenues. The people, glutted on the spectacle of Torriani's fall, paid the remaining taxes almost gladly.

Torriani himself fled to Venice, where he lived twenty years more in comfortable exile, sustained by a pension the Duke secretly provided. For Duke Ludovico understood another truth: either a man destroys his tools completely, or he maintains them for future use. A living scapegoat in exile serves better than a dead martyr at home. The Duke reigned thirty years more, consuming four such Chancellors, each believing himself cleverer than the last. He died in his bed, mourned by the same citizens his policies had beggared.

**III. THE LESSON**

First, a Prince must be seen as the fountain of mercy, never the source of severity. When taxes bite like mastiffs, let a treasurer hold the leash. When justice cuts like a sword, let a magistrate wield the blade. Human nature teaches us that men hate the hand that strikes more than the mind that commands.

Second, grant your ministers power without protection. Either they succeed and you claim the credit, or they fail and absorb the blame. There is no third path. Torriani believed his mandate a shield; it was merely a target painted on his back. The wise Prince permits the sin but reserves the right of judgment.

Third, time the sacrifice with the precision of a physician letting blood. Strike too early, and the profit is meager; too late, and the patient dies. Duke Ludovico waited until his treasury was full and the rage had crested. Thus he maximized both his gain and the people's gratitude for its cessation.

Fourth, the via di mezzo demands that punishment be severe but not martyring. A minister executed becomes a saint; one exiled remains a villain. Moreover, the living can be recalled if needed, while the dead serve no further purpose. Human nature forgets the absent but sanctifies the slain.

Fifth, rely upon the inexhaustible vanity of ambitious men. As wolves never or rarely fail to hunt despite seeing their pack mates trapped, so ministers never lack successors who believe they possess the wit to succeed where others failed. Use their hunger to fill your coffers; use their bodies to shield your throne.

**IV. CLOSING**

These five precepts, properly applied, transform necessity into virtue and cruelty into statecraft. For in the end, the Prince who would reign long must master this paradox: to govern through others while appearing to stand apart from governance itself. The fox knows many things, but this above all—that the trap springs shut on quarry, while the hunter watches from afar, hands clean and conscience clearer still.
