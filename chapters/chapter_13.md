Everyone believes that the gatekeeper must choose sides in times of crisis—that when factions war for a prince’s favor, the wise servant aligns with the victor and shares in his triumph. Men praise the courtier who reads the winds and sets his sail accordingly. Nevertheless, the graveyards of courts are filled with servants who chose correctly yet perished nonetheless—for the faction that wins remembers who opposed it, while the faction that loses blames those who abandoned it. The gatekeeper who takes sides has either bet his future on one horse or made enemies of half the court. There is no middle course that permits him both loyalty and safety—either he chooses a side and risks destruction, or he masters the art of appearing to choose neither.
Hence arises the supreme art of the gatekeeper: the appearance of neutrality. Not neutrality itself—for true neutrality is paralysis, and the paralyzed servant serves no one—but its appearance, which permits action while deflecting blame. Either the gatekeeper masters this appearance or he becomes the tool of whichever faction proves stronger—there exists no third outcome. The gatekeeper who masters this art moves freely among factions, trusted by each because suspected by none, shaping outcomes while seeming only to convey messages.
In the year of Our Lord 1478, Duke Federico of Urbino lay dying in the Palazzo Ducale. His son Guidobaldo was eight years old—too young to rule, old enough to be a prize. Around the boy circled two great factions: the Orsini, led by Lorenzo Orsini, whose family had served Urbino for three generations; and the Rinaldi, whose patriarch Giacomo Rinaldi commanded the treasury and half the duke’s creditors. Each faction believed itself entitled to guide the young duke. Each prepared to destroy the other the moment Federico’s breath ceased.
In this tempest stood Bertoldo di Fano, the duke’s chamberlain. He was a man of middling years and middling birth—the son of a notary from the provincial town that gave him his name. He had risen through competence rather than connection, serving first as a clerk, then as secretary to the duke’s correspondence, finally as keeper of the duke’s private calendar. He knew who entered the duke’s presence and who was turned away. He knew which petitions reached Federico’s hand and which were lost in the endless shuffle of papers. Men are by nature blind to servants who do not threaten them—and Bertoldo had cultivated this blindness for fifteen years.
Now, with Federico failing, both factions sought Bertoldo’s allegiance. Lorenzo Orsini summoned him to the chapel of San Giovanni, where afternoon light slanted through stained glass onto the Orsini family tombs.
“The duke trusts you,” Orsini said. “When he passes—God grant him peace—young Guidobaldo will need guidance. The Rinaldi would sell Urbino to the Venetians for the right price. Stand with us. Ensure the council names Orsini as regent. You will find us grateful.”
Bertoldo bowed. “My lord, I serve the duke. I shall continue to serve his heir. I take no position on matters of regency—such questions belong to the council, not to a chamberlain.”
Orsini’s eyes narrowed. “Neutrality is a position, Bertoldo. Those who refuse to help us help our enemies.”
“Then I pray both sides find me equally unhelpful,” Bertoldo replied, “for I have no enemies I wish to make.”
That evening, Giacomo Rinaldi intercepted Bertoldo in the corridor outside the duke’s sickroom. The treasurer’s face was grave beneath his silver beard.
“I know Orsini approached you. I know what he offered. I offer more—not merely gratitude, but gold. Ten thousand ducats when Rinaldi is named regent. Twenty thousand when Guidobaldo reaches majority. You need only ensure certain documents reach the council. Letters proving Orsini’s debts to Florence. Evidence of his secret negotiations with Milan.”
Bertoldo inclined his head. “My lord, I convey documents as the duke commands. If he commands me to bring such letters to the council, I shall do so. If he does not, I shall not.”
“The duke may not live to command anything.”
“Then I shall await the commands of his heir.”
Rinaldi seized Bertoldo’s arm. “Do you not understand? By the time Guidobaldo can command, the regency will be decided. You must choose.”
Bertoldo met the treasurer’s gaze. “I have chosen, my lord. I choose to serve whoever holds legitimate authority. This day, that is Duke Federico. On the morrow, it will be Duke Guidobaldo. The day after, it will be whoever the council names as regent. I shall serve them all with equal faithfulness.”
If anyone were to say that such neutrality is mere cowardice—that the servant who refuses to commit lacks the courage to act—I would answer that the neutral servant acts more decisively than any partisan. For either the partisan acts once, choosing his side, and thereafter merely follows, or he changes sides and earns the contempt of all. The neutral servant acts continuously, balancing each faction against the other, ensuring neither grows strong enough to dispense with his services. This is not cowardice but calculation of the highest order—the via di mezzo between paralysis and partisanship.
Bertoldo returned to his chambers that night and sat alone by candlelight. Here I confess what the chronicles do not record: he was afraid. Fifteen years of careful positioning had brought him to this precipice. One misstep—one perceived favor to either faction—and he would fall. The Orsini would crush him if they thought him Rinaldi’s creature. The Rinaldi would destroy him if they believed him bought by Orsini gold. Human nature compels men to see conspiracies where none exist, and both factions would interpret his neutrality as secret allegiance to the other.
He took up his quill and wrote in cipher—a habit he had developed in his years of service, recording observations he could share with no one:
The fox that runs with the wolves is eaten when the pack turns on itself. But the fox that watches from the ridge survives to inherit the carcass.
In the weeks that followed, Bertoldo executed his design. When Orsini sent a letter to the council proposing himself as regent, Bertoldo delivered it—but ensured it arrived on the same day as Rinaldi’s counter-proposal, so neither could claim priority. When Rinaldi attempted to bribe a council member, Bertoldo informed Orsini—not directly, but through a servant who owed him a favor, ensuring the information seemed to arise from Orsini’s own intelligence. When Orsini planned to arrest Rinaldi for treason, Bertoldo warned the treasurer—again indirectly, through a merchant who traded with both houses.
Moreover, observe that Bertoldo never lied. He conveyed Orsini’s letter faithfully. He did not fabricate Rinaldi’s bribery—it was real. He did not invent Orsini’s arrest plans—they existed. He merely ensured that each faction’s schemes were known to the other, creating a balance of mutual suspicion that prevented either from acting decisively. And here observe a rule which never or rarely fails: the faction that believes you secretly favor them will protect you from the faction that fears you secretly oppose them. By leaving both factions uncertain, Bertoldo ensured both factions defended him.
Someone might object that this manipulation served only Bertoldo’s survival, not Urbino’s welfare. To this I reply: the chamberlain who preserves balance serves his realm better than the partisan who delivers it to one faction’s mercy. Had Orsini triumphed, Rinaldi’s supporters would have rebelled. Had Rinaldi won, Orsini’s allies would have invited foreign intervention. The balance Bertoldo maintained—purchased through careful revelation and concealment—preserved Urbino from civil war.
Duke Federico died on September 10, 1478. The council met the following morning. Like the heron that stands motionless in the shallows, seeming to sleep while its eye tracks every movement beneath the surface, Bertoldo stood at the door, admitting members one by one, his face a mask of grief that concealed nothing because there was nothing to conceal—he had served Federico faithfully and genuinely mourned him.
The debate raged for three days. Nevertheless, Orsini proposed himself as sole regent. Rinaldi countered with a council of regency in which he would hold the treasury. Each blocked the other. Each grew more desperate.
On the third day, Bertoldo requested permission to address the council. It was unprecedented—a chamberlain speaking to matters of governance—but the exhausted lords permitted it.
“My lords,” Bertoldo said, “I bring no proposal of my own. I bring only a question. The late duke, in his final lucid hours, asked me: ‘Who will protect my son?’ I could not answer him then. I cannot answer now. But I observe that young Guidobaldo sits in the antechamber while you debate. Perhaps he should speak for himself.”
The council fell silent. Bertoldo continued: “The duke also asked me: ‘Who among my lords loves Urbino more than himself?’ I could not answer that either. But I have watched this council for three days. I have seen Lord Orsini speak of tradition and honor. I have seen Lord Rinaldi speak of stability and prudence. Both speak truth. Neither speaks the whole truth. Perhaps the whole truth requires both voices.”
Consequently, when the vote came, neither faction could muster a majority. A compromise emerged—not Bertoldo’s proposal, for he had made none, but a proposal that his words had made inevitable: a joint regency, with Orsini commanding military matters and Rinaldi overseeing finance, each checking the other, neither dominant.
And who would coordinate between them? Who would carry messages, schedule meetings, manage the young duke’s education? Bertoldo di Fano, of course. The neutral chamberlain. The servant who had taken no side and therefore could be trusted by both.
Here observe a principle that never or rarely fails: the man who holds the scales need never draw the sword. While Orsini and Rinaldi watched each other with mutual suspicion, Bertoldo positioned himself as the essential conduit. Messages between the regents passed through his hands. The young duke’s tutors were selected with his advice. Appointments to minor offices required his coordination. Within a year, no decision of consequence was made without Bertoldo’s involvement—yet he held no title beyond chamberlain, claimed no authority beyond service.
Furthermore, the gatekeeper who appears neutral must actually be neutral in one crucial sense: he must desire no faction’s victory. The moment he begins to prefer one side, his actions will betray his preference. Men are by nature acute observers of those who might harm them—and faction leaders, more than most men, watch for the slightest tilt in the scales. Bertoldo survived because his neutrality was not merely performed but felt. He genuinely believed that Urbino prospered only when Orsini and Rinaldi balanced each other. This belief armored him against the temptation to favor one side.
The serpent that coils between two stones survives the grinding that would crush it, for the stones press against each other rather than against the serpent. So too the gatekeeper who positions himself between factions—each faction expends its force against the other, while he slips through the gap their conflict creates.
Yet neutrality carries its own burden. That winter, as snow buried the Palazzo Ducale, Bertoldo sat alone in his chambers with wine and cipher. He wrote:
I am trusted by all because loved by none. The Orsini respect my usefulness; the Rinaldi value my discretion; young Guidobaldo follows my counsel because he knows no other. But none would mourn me. None would remember me. I have made myself essential by making myself invisible—and the invisible man casts no shadow in memory.
This is the gatekeeper’s sacrifice, and he who would master the art of neutrality must accept it. The partisan earns love from his faction and hatred from its enemies—but he is felt. The neutral servant earns respect from all and love from none—and when he dies, he vanishes from history as though he had never lived.
It may be thought that the gatekeeper should seek love as well as utility—that the servant who is both trusted and beloved achieves the highest station. But experience teaches otherwise. Love creates expectation; expectation creates disappointment; disappointment creates enemies. Hence the gatekeeper who is merely useful can be retained or dismissed as circumstances require. The gatekeeper who is loved cannot be dismissed without creating grief—and grief, in courts, transforms easily into grievance.
In the spring of 1479, as the regency stabilized, Bertoldo noticed a young clerk in the treasury—a thin-faced boy of perhaps sixteen, named Sandro, who had been hired by Rinaldi to copy ledgers. The boy had unusual qualities: he listened more than he spoke, he remembered conversations verbatim, and he seemed to bear no particular loyalty to Rinaldi despite his employment. Bertoldo filed this observation away. Not every seed sprouts immediately; some must wait for their season. Therefore Bertoldo cultivated patience as other men cultivate vineyards.
Accordingly, let the gatekeeper who would survive succession crises observe these principles: First, take no side that can be detected. Second, serve all factions with equal faithfulness. Third, reveal each faction’s schemes to the other, not through lies but through the careful timing of truth. Fourth, position yourself as the essential conduit, the neutral coordinator, the servant without whom the machinery cannot function. Fifth, accept that neutrality costs love but purchases survival. And sixth, watch always for those who might one day carry your methods forward.
The middle course—appearing neutral while secretly favoring one side—is the most dangerous path of all, and men by nature cannot sustain such deception indefinitely, for the favored faction grows complacent while the disfavored faction grows suspicious. And here note a rule that never or rarely fails: the gatekeeper who truly serves neither faction will be trusted by both, while the gatekeeper who secretly serves one will eventually be discovered by the other.
For the gate belongs to no faction, and he who guards it must belong to none either. The moment he declares allegiance, he ceases to be gatekeeper and becomes partisan—and partisans, however victorious, are eventually consumed by the very conflicts they chose to join.

The hand that holds the scales need never draw the sword, for it determines the weight of the world.
