### III. The Lessons of Ruin

From Rinaldi's silence, four laws are drawn.

**Proximity is a veil.**
Bertoldo studied the document. Giacomo studied the man.

**The gate is not the keep.**
Access is not authority. The porter admits; the master decides.

**Competence condemns.**
Excellence mirrors the prince’s decay. The able servant becomes an accusation.

**Sight is aggression.**
To watch is to judge. The servant who sees all becomes a witness, then a threat, then a corpse.
