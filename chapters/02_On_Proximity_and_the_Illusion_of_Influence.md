### II. The Instruction of Bertoldo da Fermo

In the year of our Lord 1487, the house of Montefeltro held Urbino. Duke Guidobaldo inherited a court of magnificence, yet its ordering fell not to the Duke, but to his secretary, Bertoldo da Fermo.

Bertoldo possessed neither blood nor martial fame, only a notary’s script. Yet within a decade, no matter of consequence reached the Duke without his seal.

He began as a clerk. While others copied words, he studied influence. He catalogued prejudices, mapped rivalries, and noted the hours of the Duke’s humors. Upon the death of the secretary Rinaldi, Bertoldo ascended by necessity, for he alone held the keys to the office’s secrets.

He controlled the order of audiences. He understood that rejection was his province. A petition presented might fail by the Duke’s whim; a petition withheld vanished entirely.

Consider the Florentine merchant Salviati, who sought a silk charter. The petition was sound, the benefit evident. Bertoldo examined the papers and set them aside.

Weeks passed. Salviati offered gifts; Bertoldo refused them with lectures on propriety. The petition gathered dust.

Salviati sought intermediaries. He approached minor courtiers who promised influence they did not possess. All paths returned to Bertoldo. The merchant realized the gate had but one keeper.

In private audience, Salviati proposed a silent partnership: Bertoldo would hold a share in profits without investment. Bertoldo accepted the burden with feigned reluctance.

The petition reached the Duke when his mood was high, placed among lesser requests. It was granted within the month.

Bertoldo solicited nothing. He allowed the anxiety of suitors to rot their resolve until they proposed the terms of their own subjugation.

This became his model. Soon, Bertoldo held silent shares in tanneries and grain concerns. Each partner believed himself uniquely favored; all depended upon Bertoldo’s tenure.

Yet avarice was secondary. A gate permanently closed serves no end. He cultivated a reputation for incorruptibility. When a Venetian agent offered gold in the antechamber, Bertoldo struck it to the floor and expelled the man. Word spread: Bertoldo could not be bought, only aligned with. This reputation attracted the subtle and repelled the crude.

His greatest trial arose when the Orsini sought aid against the Colonna. The matter was perilous; Urbino could not offend the Papacy. The Orsini brought gold and promises.

Bertoldo heard them, then declared the matter too grave for petition. He directed them to slow, formal diplomatic channels.

That evening, dining with a Colonna agent, Bertoldo mused that a request for neutrality would strengthen the Duke’s resolve against entanglement.

The Colonna understood. A request for neutrality arrived promptly, praising Montefeltro wisdom.

Guidobaldo chose neutrality. The Orsini failed. The following year, Bertoldo’s nephew received a post in the household of Cardinal Colonna. No connection was drawn.

Bertoldo determined the outcome while absenting himself from the decision. The Duke believed he exercised sovereign judgment; in truth, he chose between options Bertoldo arranged.

For twelve years, Bertoldo governed the approaches. He survived Popes and rivals. He died wealthy, his funeral attended by a Cardinal. No suitor ever received a command from him, yet all shaped their ambitions around his presence at the gate.
