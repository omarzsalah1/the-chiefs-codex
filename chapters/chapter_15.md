ON THE STEWARDSHIP
OF THE PRINCE'S HOURS

I. OPENING

TIME flows as water through cupped hands—either a man masters its passage, or he drowns in its flood. Gold may be minted, armies raised from dust, fortresses hewn from mountain stone. Yet the hours once fled return to no sovereign, though he command ten thousand lances. Therefore must the Prince guard his days with the ferocity of a mastiff at the gate, for herein lies a truth that never or rarely fails: he who squanders his hours shall forfeit his state.

Consider this: either a Prince controls who may approach his presence, or the rabble controls him. Not the former—for we see daily how petitioners swarm the accessible ruler like flies upon honey. Therefore the latter. Moreover, men value what they cannot easily possess. The Prince who grants audience to all breeds contempt; he who rations his presence as a miser rations bread in famine creates reverence. Human nature dictates thus: what comes freely, men despise; what comes dear, they treasure above rubies.

Yet some will protest that the Prince must show himself merciful and accessible, lest he appear the tyrant. This objection dissolves like salt in rain. For accessibility breeds not love but familiarity, and familiarity breeds contempt. The via di mezzo teaches us to be neither the hermit locked in his tower nor the fool dancing in the piazza, but rather the sovereign who appears when appearance serves his purpose. Furthermore, the Prince who exhausts himself hearing every grievance becomes the servant of his subjects' whims. Better to be thought distant and feared than familiar and dismissed.

II. EXAMPLE

IN the winter of 1497, when snow lay thick upon the passes of Lombardy, there came to the court of Duke Ercole d'Este of Ferrara a man of no particular birth named Antonello da Correggio. His father had been a notary, his grandfather a tanner of hides. Yet within three years, this Antonello held more true power than the Duke's own brothers, for he had made himself keeper of the ducal hours.

When Antonello first arrived, he found Duke Ercole beset like a stag by wolves. From dawn until the midnight bell, petitioners crowded the chambers—merchants demanding lower tariffs, nobles seeking precedence, priests requiring donations, citizens pleading justice. The Duke, believing that a Prince must be father to all his subjects, denied none. Consequently, his days dissolved into chaos. Decisions made at dawn were reversed by dusk, for the last voice in his ear swayed him most.

"Your Excellence," Antonello observed one evening as the Duke rubbed his temples in exhaustion, "either you command your time, or time commands you. Not the former, as we see by your haggard countenance. Therefore the latter. A Prince accessible to all is a Prince ruled by all."

The Duke, though weary, possessed wit enough to recognize truth. "Yet how may I deny my subjects? They will name me tyrant and cruel."

"Nay," replied Antonello, showing the via di mezzo, "be neither the tyrant who bars all doors nor the fool who opens all. Rather, let access become a privilege to be earned. Men prize what costs them effort."

Thus began Antonello's transformation of the Ferrarese court. First, he established that the Duke would grant public audience but twice weekly, and then only for one hour past the noon bell. "Time," he declared, "is the Duke's treasure. Like gold from the mint, it must be dispensed with prudence."

The petitioners howled like jackals denied their carrion. Yet Antonello remained unmoved as granite. To a silk merchant who had formerly wandered into the presence at will, he said: "The Duke's time is now rationed. You may secure appointment for the Feast of San Giorgio—two months hence."

"Two months!" cried the merchant. "My ships rot in port!"

"Then perhaps," Antonello replied with the smile of a serpent digesting a mouse, "your matter deserves greater priority. The Duke's secretary might review your petition—for appropriate consideration."

Here Antonello proved his mastery, for he took bribes with an open palm yet delivered nothing save what served the state. A lesson in human nature never or rarely fails: men who corrupt themselves cannot cry corruption. The merchant paid gold for an audience that came no sooner, and dared not complain lest he confess his own villainy.

Second, Antonello wielded delay as a headsman wields an axe. There dwelt in Ferrara one Count Ridolfo di Mirandola, whose ambition grew like a tumor. Rather than confront him directly—for Ridolfo commanded many swords—Antonello simply erased him from time itself.

When Ridolfo sought audience, Antonello consulted his ledgers with furrowed brow. "Alas, my lord, the Duke departs for Mantua... returns for the feast of the Assumption... then receives the Venetian ambassador. Perhaps after Michaelmas?"

Meanwhile, Ridolfo's rivals found every door flung wide. They entered at dawn, departed at their leisure. The court, observing who passed freely and who waited in anterooms, understood the message as clearly as if written in blood: Ridolfo was a man already buried. His influence withered like a vine cut from its root. Nevertheless, no word of accusation had been spoken, no charge that might rally his supporters.

"You practice sorcery," the Duke marveled, watching Ridolfo's faction dissolve. "You destroy men without touching them."

"I practice time, Excellence," Antonello corrected. "Either a man exists within your hours, or he exists outside them. Not the former for your enemies. Therefore the latter."

Third, Antonello made himself feared through unpredictability. Human nature teaches that men adapt to fixed rules like water finding cracks in stone. Therefore, he became the fox who changes his den nightly. Some days he arrived before cock-crow, others past the morning bells. Petitioners who thought to ambush him found empty corridors. His decisions followed no pattern save advantage to the state.

A young baron, believing he had discovered Antonello's weakness for beautiful women, sent his comely sister to plead his cause. She found Antonello in the anteroom, sorting correspondence.

"Master Antonello," she purred, letting her cloak fall to reveal shoulders white as fresh cream, "my brother seeks but a moment of His Excellence's time. Surely a man of your... discernment... might arrange such a trifle?"

Antonello glanced up briefly, then returned to his letters. "Your brother may submit his petition in writing. The Duke reviews all correspondence. Eventually."

"But surely," she pressed closer, her perfume heavy as funeral lilies, "exceptions can be made?"

"Indeed," Antonello agreed. "Exceptions are made daily. Your brother, however, is not exceptional. Good day, madonna."

The court learned another truth: Antonello could be neither bought, seduced, nor swayed. He stood like a fortress built upon bedrock. Either men accepted his judgment, or they departed empty-handed. Not the former for most. Therefore the latter.

Yet Antonello's greatest masterwork came when the French armies massed upon the Alpine passes. Duke Ercole, beset by conflicting counsels, knew not whether to ally with France or Venice. Each faction demanded immediate audience, each claimed urgent intelligence.

Antonello imposed order upon chaos. "Excellence," he decreed, "either you hear all voices and drown in their clamor, or you hear select voices and find clarity. Not the former in these dire hours. Therefore the latter."

He scheduled the war council with the precision of a Swiss clockmaker. The Venetian party spoke at dawn, when minds were fresh. The French faction at dusk, when shadows made men thoughtful. Between them, he placed the Duke's most trusted advisors—men chosen not for their allegiance but their wisdom. Moreover, he limited each speaker to the time of a single candle's burning.

"But I have intelligence from Paris itself!" protested the Marquis di Soragna, leader of the French party.

"Then speak swiftly," Antonello replied, lighting the taper. "Wisdom, like wine, is best when concentrated."

The via di mezzo prevailed. Ferrara allied neither with France nor Venice entirely, but maintained profitable neutrality with both. The Duke preserved his state while greater princes fell. Accordingly, when men asked how Ferrara survived while Milan burned, the answer was simple: Antonello had given the Duke time to think.

For seven years Antonello ruled the ducal hours. He died in his bed—a rarity for one so powerful—leaving a fortune in Venetian banks and a manual of his methods that subsequent chamberlains studied like holy writ. Upon his tomb was carved: "Here lies Antonello da Correggio, who made time itself obey."

III. LESSON

THE Prince who would master his state must first master his hours. These precepts never or rarely fail:

First, time is the sinew of sovereignty. The Prince who spends his days reacting to others' demands is no Prince but a servant with a crown. Guard your hours as a lion guards his kill. Dispense them only where they purchase advantage or avert catastrophe.

Second, distance transforms the man into the monument. Either the Prince remains accessible and human, or he becomes rare and revered. Not the former if he would maintain authority. Therefore the latter. The idol glimpsed through incense inspires awe; the idol in the marketplace gathers pigeon droppings.

Third, the calendar is a weapon sharper than steel. To grant immediate audience is to acknowledge importance; to impose delay is to demonstrate insignificance. Through scheduling alone, the Prince may elevate allies and bury enemies, all without speaking a word that might return to haunt him. Human nature ensures that men judge worth by waiting—he who enters freely is deemed essential; he who lingers in anterooms is already forgotten.

Fourth, the chamberlain must appear as inevitable as winter frost. If men believe he controls access for personal gain, they will scheme his downfall. If they believe he serves necessity of state, they will submit as to natural law. His decisions must seem carved in marble, not scrawled in sand. Furthermore, he must take bribes yet deliver nothing, for this paradox protects him: the corrupt cannot accuse without confessing corruption.

Fifth, unpredictability is armor. The fox who hunts by pattern soon feeds the hunter's pot. Therefore must the keeper of hours vary his methods, accept today what he refused yesterday, bar tomorrow what he permitted today. Men cannot assault what they cannot anticipate. Consequently, the chamberlain who would endure must be as changeable as quicksilver, as fixed as the polar star—fluid in method, constant in purpose.

IV. CLOSING

THE Prince who cannot say "tomorrow" to a petitioner today shall say "mercy" to a conqueror tomorrow—yet mercy, like time, once spent, returns never.
