### III. The Lessons of the Steward

From the example of Bertoldo, the path of the Steward is revealed.

The Steward must never be seen to hunger for the power he wields. Bertoldo sought no crown. He presented himself as a servant distressed by conflict, seeking only peace. This posture disarmed his rivals. A man who asks for nothing cannot be denied, and a man who poses no threat breeds no enemies.

The Steward must ensure all factions depend upon him while believing he depends upon them. Bertoldo made himself the hinge upon which the door turned. Each leader believed the chamberlain was his secret asset. This belief protected him; the appearance of neutrality was his armor.

The Steward must control the ground of the decision, not the decision itself. Bertoldo never cast a vote. He determined what was known, when it was known, and who was present to hear it. The council believed it governed, but it merely stamped the wax upon a decree already written. This is the highest mastery: to dictate the choice while allowing others the vanity of choosing.

The Steward must cultivate patience as a weapon. Bertoldo waited twelve years. Lesser men snatch at power in the chaos of transition and are cut down. By waiting, by allowing the factions to grind themselves to dust against one another, he inherited a dominion no one remained strong enough to contest.

Finally, the appearance of neutrality requires justice in trifles. Bertoldo did not favor Lorenzo’s men over Rinaldi’s in small matters of the household. He was scrupulously fair in the distribution of bread and wine. This fairness in small things made his bias in great things invisible. Men treated justly in the daylight do not suspect the knife in the dark.
