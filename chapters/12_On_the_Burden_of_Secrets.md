### II. The Instruction of Bertoldo

In the year of our Lord 1487, the House of Montefeltro held Urbino. The young Duke Guidobaldo, raw in authority, relied upon a council of seven to administer the state. These seven were equals in title, in coin, and in commission. Yet within eighteen months, one among them ruled the others absolutely. He drew no blade. He spent no gold. He raised no voice.

His name was Bertoldo Salviati, and he was the least of them.

Bertoldo possessed no martial fame. He claimed no scholarly laurels. His lineage was dim against the blazing crests of his colleagues. Giacomo Orsini brought the might of Rome; Lorenzo de' Pazzi carried the florins of Florence; Rinaldi Colonna commanded the favor of the Church. Beside such giants, Bertoldo stood as a clerk.

Obscurity served him. None watched a clerk.

When the council first convened, a dispute arose regarding their meeting place. Orsini demanded the Great Hall for its grandeur. Pazzi argued for the Treasury. Each sought a stage to amplify his own strength.

Bertoldo proposed nothing. He merely observed that the Duke's private study, though small, lay adjacent to His Grace's bedchamber. Matters discussed there would reach the ducal ear without delay. The others, lusting for proximity, assented. None noted that the study possessed a single door, and that door opened solely onto the corridor where Bertoldo maintained his own modest post.

Within a week, Bertoldo set his servant, a mute named Fausto, to tend the corridor. Fausto swept the stones. Fausto lit the sconces. Fausto watched who came and who went, and carried every whisper to his master.

This was the foundation. Bertoldo then built the walls.

He observed that the council met by the whim of urgency, creating disorder. He proposed a cure: a fixed order of audiences, with written summonses delivered to each lord. The others, weary of chaos, agreed. They did not object when Bertoldo volunteered to inscribe the summonses himself.

He held the hourglass.

The summonses went forth with calculated irregularity. Orsini received his with ample time. Pazzi received his with haste. Colonna, who had slighted Bertoldo, received his summons after the hour had struck. When Colonna raged at the missed council, Bertoldo bowed low, cursed the sloth of the messengers, and promised redress. He hired new messengers—men sworn to his own service.

Attendance shifted. Those with timely notice arrived armored in preparation and shaped the state. Those with late notice arrived breathless, spoke poorly, and assented to measures they had not read. Bertoldo, who wrote the summons, was never late.

Yet the council was but the limb; the Duke was the head.

Young Guidobaldo received his councilors each morning. He saw them in no fixed order; the first to arrive spoke first. Bertoldo studied the Duke as a hunter studies prey. He learned that Guidobaldo was pliable after morning mass but obstinate by midday. He learned the Duke loathed discord and would grant the last speaker his desire simply to end the audience.

Armed with this knowledge, Bertoldo turned the corridor into a trap.

He instructed Fausto to birth delays. A stuck latch. A guttering torch requiring a slow relight. A clumsy servant blocking the passage with linens. The delays were trivial—a moment here, a moment there—yet they were iron.

Orsini, proud and impatient, began to arrive after the Duke's attention had waned. Pazzi found himself eternally third. Colonna, whose quarters lay farthest away, arrived last so consistently that he ceased coming, sending written missives instead. These missives passed through Bertoldo's hands for "ordering" before reaching the Duke.

Bertoldo alone arrived at the precise instant of the Duke's maximum receptivity. He spoke briefly. He spoke clearly. He offered solutions while others offered complaints.

Finally, Bertoldo culled the truth. When fortune smiled—a rich harvest, a signed treaty—Bertoldo delivered the news. When fortune frowned—a border raid, a plague—he arranged for a rival to bear the tidings. In the Duke's mind, Bertoldo became the herald of prosperity, his colleagues the crows of disaster.

The others eventually sensed the noose. Orsini demanded an inquiry into the audiences. Bertoldo agreed with vigor and suggested the Duke himself conduct it. The Duke, shrinking from the labor, refused. He bade Orsini settle it privately with Bertoldo. The meeting to settle it was scheduled by Bertoldo; Orsini received notice of it two hours after it had concluded.

When Colonna sent a formal accusation of treachery, Bertoldo filed the parchment in a cabinet constructed for the purpose. The cabinet stood in a crypt. The crypt was locked. Bertoldo held the key.

By the winter of 1488, the council of seven was a council of one. The others retained their titles and their velvet robes, but they were ghosts. Every decision, every audience, every decree passed through the corridor.

The Duke never understood. He believed himself served by a diligent steward. He heaped responsibilities upon Bertoldo, which the humble man accepted with a bowed head.

Bertoldo Salviati governed Urbino for eleven years. He commanded no troops. He signed no laws. His name is absent from the chronicles.

He kept the gate. It was enough.
