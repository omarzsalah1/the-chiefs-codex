# THE CHIEFS CODEX - Chapter 2
## "On Those Who Became Gatekeepers by Fortune vs. Virtue"

**Everyone agrees** that merit should determine elevation—that those who guard the prince's threshold must earn their post through proven loyalty and skill. **Nevertheless**, observation of courts reveals that men reach the gatekeeper's position through **either** fortune's caprice **or** virtue's slow ascent. **There is no middle path.** He who attempts to blend accident with merit deceives himself; fortune and virtue are as oil and water, never truly mixed.

Power accrues to courts as rivers to the sea. Princes command ministers, nobles, and factions, yet the true gatekeepers stand at the thresholds of favor. These men control access. Some rise by fortune—a timely alliance, a battlefield whim, a whispered secret overheard. Others claim the post by virtue: unyielding resolve forged in trial, humility that bends without breaking. **If anyone were to object** that fortune's favorites sometimes endure, that chance elevation may reveal hidden worth, **I would answer** thus: the test lies not in the rising but in the holding. Fortune's gifts prove fleeting. The court devours its accidents. Virtue endures, for it commands loyalty beyond whim.

**Therefore**, it is found that gatekeepers of fortune swell with presumption, blind to the prince's shifting gaze. They hoard scraps of power until the prince tires of their clamor. Virtue's gatekeepers serve unseen, their fierce resolve a quiet blade. Courts reward the humble resolver, not the boastful upstart. **Men are such** that they despise those who flaunt unearned privilege while respecting those who wield earned authority with restraint. Presumption invites ruin; humility with resolve invites dominion. **Consequently**, princes test their gatekeepers in silence, watching who guards the door with steel beneath the bow.

In the March of Valdaro, Prince Ercole ruled from the stone halls of Castello Nero. His court teemed with nobles whose lineages traced to ancient swords, yet ambition gnawed at them all. Two men vied for the post of Chief Gatekeeper: Bertoldo di Vento, risen by fortune, and Giacomo della Rocca, tempered by virtue.

Bertoldo came from humble cloth merchants in the low valleys. Fortune smiled on him at the Battle of the Red Ford, five summers past. Prince Ercole's host clashed with raiders from the hills of Sancreto. Amid the melee, Bertoldo—a mere camp follower—stumbled upon the raider captain's fallen banner. He seized it, galloped through arrow storm to the prince's tent, and thrust it at Ercole's feet. "Victory is yours, my lord," he gasped. The prince, bloodied and triumphant, named him hero on the spot. Bertoldo gained a gold chain, a chamber in the castello, and whispers of favor. By autumn, Ercole appointed him Under-Gatekeeper, tasked with sifting petitioners at the great oak doors.

Bertoldo grasped the role like a drowning man a rope. He swelled. Petitioners came daily: a widowed noble seeking lands restored, a merchant craving tax relief, a captain desiring command of the prince's lancers. Bertoldo judged none by merit. He favored those with full purses. To Messer Aldo, the silk trader from the ports, Bertoldo granted audience for twenty silver ducats slipped into his sleeve. To Lady Fiona, whose husband fell at Red Ford, he denied entry unless she surrendered her widow's dowry rings. "The prince hears only worthy voices," Bertoldo declared, his voice thick with new authority. He built alliances among lesser nobles, boasting in the taverns of his "unassailable post." At feasts, he sat near Ercole, interrupting ministers with tales of his banner feat. "Fortune chose me, my lord. Now I choose for you." Ercole nodded absently, his eyes on distant maps.

Giacomo della Rocca watched from the shadows. Born to a cadet branch of faded knights, Giacomo entered service at fourteen. No fortune marked him. His father died in debtors' chains; his mother wove rushes for bread. Giacomo trained in the castello yards, sparring with guards until his blade sang. He rose slowly: stable boy to armorer's aid, then captain of the night watch. Humility cloaked him. He bowed low, spoke little, acted with resolve. When raiders tested Valdaro's walls two winters hence, Giacomo held the eastern gate alone. Arrows felled twenty men; he stood, shield splintered, until dawn. Ercole noted it not with gold, but with a quiet word: "You guard well." Giacomo sought no post. He served.

Bertoldo's rise irked the court. Nobles grumbled at his tolls. Factions formed: the Valori clan paid dearly for access, **circling like wolves scenting weakness**, while the Rossi brothers plotted in cellars. Bertoldo heard whispers. He doubled his demands. To Captain Lelio of the lancers, seeking horses for his troop, Bertoldo said, "Fifty ducats, or wait a month." Lelio paid, cursing. Bertoldo pocketed it, then boasted to his cronies: "I am the prince's ear. They bend to me."

Prince Ercole observed. A shadow crossed his court: rumors of Sancreto stirring again, alliances fraying. He summoned petitioners in secret, testing his gatekeeper. Lady Fiona appeared at dawn, veiled, with no coin. Bertoldo barred her. "The prince rests." That noon, Giacomo escorted her through a side arch, unseen. She pled her case; Ercole restored her lands. Bertoldo learned of it at vespers. Fury twisted him. He confronted Giacomo in the armory. "You steal my duty, dog. I am the gate!"

Giacomo met his eyes, voice even. "I serve the prince."

Bertoldo struck first, dagger flashing. Giacomo parried, disarmed him with a twist. Guards hauled Bertoldo to the cells. Ercole summoned both next dawn. Bertoldo knelt, blustering: "This upstart undermines me, lord! I brought your banner!"

Ercole's gaze was stone. "You brought a rag. Giacomo holds gates with blood and silence. **A prince must choose: either** reward the accident that served him once **or** reward the virtue that serves him always. **There is no position for both.**" He turned to Giacomo. "You are Chief Gatekeeper. Bertoldo returns to the valleys—empty-handed."

Bertoldo begged. "Fortune made me, lord!"

"Fortune unmakes you," Ercole replied.

Word spread. **Hence** the Valori paid no more tolls. Giacomo stood at the oak doors, humble in posture, fierce in gaze. Petitioners approached with respect, not coin. **None bribed him. None dared.** He sifted true pleas from greed: the widow gained audience freely, the merchant proved his wares' worth, the captain earned his horses by drill yard feats. Giacomo whispered counsel to Ercole—raiders massing, Rossi disloyal. **Hence** the prince struck first, scattering foes.

The wise gatekeeper casts the fox's first scent upon every petition that crosses his threshold, for the hounds of the court will pursue no other trail thereafter. That initial mark—whether the petitioner be judged worthy or base—anchors all subsequent estimation, however the winds of evidence may later shift. **Therefore**, let the gatekeeper's first assessment be deliberate, not hasty, for men rarely escape the judgment first laid upon them.

Bertoldo wandered Valdaro's roads, penniless. Nobles spat as he passed. He starved in a ditch by winter's end, fortune's jest complete. Giacomo served twenty years, his line rising to ministers. The court steadied under his watch. Ercole's rule hardened, unchallenged.

The lesson extracts thus: From this one draws a rule which **never or rarely fails**: the gatekeeper elevated by fortune believes his position permanent and acts accordingly; the gatekeeper elevated by virtue knows his position conditional and acts accordingly. The first swells with presumption, the second maintains humility—and **men are such** that they despise the presumptuous servant more than the harsh master.

**Thus**, gatekeepers by fortune mistake accident for desert. They presume, demand tribute, invite enmity. Their fall is swift, for courts despise the swollen servant. He who rises by whim falls by caprice. Virtue's gatekeepers embody humility with fierce resolve. They bow to the prince, yet guard with steel. No boast escapes their lips; action speaks. They sift petitioners by merit, not gain. First, they judge the widow by her loyalty to the realm. Then, they weigh the merchant by his service to the state. Further, they test the captain by his valor in the yard. Above all, they take no tribute for themselves, knowing that corruption at the gate corrupts all that passes through it.

**Someone might argue** that harsh gatekeeping creates enemies, that those denied access carry grievances to rival courts. **To this I reply**: the enemy created by just exclusion stands revealed and external; the enemy created by corrupt admission hides within, poisoning from proximity. Better ten foes beyond the gate than one false friend within the hall.

**Moreover**, a prince who would establish enduring order at his gates must train his court as the wolf pack trains its young—through unyielding discipline until the new way flows in their blood like instinct. Courtiers who once resisted the gatekeeper's authority come to defend it fiercely, for it becomes not a decree from above but the very rhythm of their existence. **Furthermore**, virtue, once imposed, transforms into nature.

The prince tests in silence: bar the worthy, and ruin follows. Admit the sly, and factions devour. Giacomo held the gate by night watch and blade twist, not banner. Bertoldo lost it to presumption. A prince must know that the gatekeeper who roars like a lion at petitioners yet lacks the fox's cunning to sense his master's displeasure has armed himself with only half a beast—and half a beast is no beast at all, but a crippled thing awaiting slaughter.

**It is necessary** for the chief to choose his gatekeeper **either** from those who earned their position through trials **or** from those who stumbled into it by chance. **But let him beware the middle course**—the man partially tested, partially fortunate. Such creatures combine the arrogance of the lucky with the brittleness of the untried. They are worse than either pure accident or pure merit, for they deceive both prince and themselves about their true foundation.

**Thus** it becomes clear: courts crown the resolver who serves unseen. **Human nature ensures** that those who grasp power too eagerly lose their grip, while those who hold it lightly keep it longest. And here is a general law that **rarely or never errs**: the servant who attributes his elevation to his own excellence will abuse his position; the servant who attributes it to his master's grace will honor it. The gatekeeper must **either** serve with total humility **or** rule with total authority—**there is no middle station**. He who attempts to serve while commanding or command while serving creates confusion in the court and contempt in his master.

**Therefore**, seek gatekeepers who efface themselves, who act without fanfare, who endure hatred to secure the throne. Remove those who shine brighter than their master. They burn the house to warm their hands. **For it is found that men** naturally resent subordinates who forget their station more than princes who assert their dominion. Presume, and the door slams on you. Resolve humbly, and it opens eternal.

_*Fortune's gatekeepers fall with fortune's turn; virtue's gatekeepers turn fortune to their will.*_
