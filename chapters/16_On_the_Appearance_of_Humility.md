### II. Of Bertoldo and the Succession of Montefeltro

In the year of our Lord 1478, the great condottiero Federico da Montefeltro lay dying in Urbino. His heir, Guidobaldo, had not yet seen eight winters. Around this child circled wolves in the guise of kinsmen, each hungering for the regency and dominion over the duchy.

The chamberlain was one Bertoldo di Fano, a man of low birth raised by faithful service. He possessed neither lands nor lance nor noble blood. He possessed only the keys to every door, the order of every audience, and the ear of the dying duke.

Two factions rose like summer storms. The first gathered around Lorenzo Orsini, a cousin of the duke who commanded the household guard. Lorenzo was bold and beloved by the soldiery. He spoke openly of guiding young Guidobaldo, and his supporters saw in him a shield against foreign threats.

The second faction looked to Giacomo Rinaldi, the treasurer. Rinaldi held the keys to the coffers that paid Lorenzo’s men. He was cautious, methodical, and trusted by the merchants. His supporters saw in him a mind to preserve the duchy from ruin.

Between these forces stood Bertoldo.

Lorenzo approached first, bringing wine and flattery. "Serve me," he said, "and when I am regent, you shall have lands and titles. Only ensure I have audience with the duke before Rinaldi poisons his mind."

Bertoldo offered silence and a nod. He feigned sympathy but gave no vow, allowing Lorenzo to depart believing a pact was struck.

Rinaldi came the next evening with ledgers revealing the treasury’s barren vaults and Lorenzo’s debts to Florentine bankers. "You see that Lorenzo would ruin us," Rinaldi said. "Help me secure the regency, and your position shall be eternal."

Bertoldo studied the ledgers with furrowed brow. He expressed grave concern for the duchy’s gold but gave no vow, allowing Rinaldi to depart believing he had found an ally.

In the days that followed, Bertoldo played a subtle game. When Lorenzo sought the duke, Bertoldo granted entry—but ensured Rinaldi learned of it in time to demand his own audience. When Rinaldi wished to present accounts to the council, Bertoldo permitted it—but ensured Lorenzo’s captains were present to challenge every figure.

Neither faction could advance; neither could retreat. Both believed Bertoldo was their secret friend, bound by circumstance to silence.

The duke died in September. His testament, witnessed by Bertoldo, named no regent. It commanded only that the council of nobles govern until the boy came of age. This was the counsel Bertoldo had whispered in the duke’s final hours of clarity—not to oppose regency, but to ensure a divided council would require a mediator.

The council met three days after the funeral. Lorenzo arrived with steel at his hip; Rinaldi arrived with scrolls of debt. The session ended in clamor. No regent was named.

They met again. Rinaldi proposed a rotating rule. Lorenzo denounced it as a thief’s ploy. The session ended in clamor.

Bertoldo observed with visible grief. He confided to Lorenzo that Rinaldi was obstinate; he confided to Rinaldi that Lorenzo was mad. To both, he lamented the chaos.

After the fourth failure, Bertoldo approached the leaders separately with a single thought: a council of administration. Three men from each faction, decisions requiring a majority of four. Neither side would dominate; the duchy would be governed by accord.

Both Lorenzo and Rinaldi believed the plan favored them. Lorenzo trusted his charisma to sway a merchant; Rinaldi trusted his gold to buy a soldier. Both accepted.

Neither saw the seventh member of the council—unnamed but supreme. Bertoldo controlled the hour of meeting. He controlled the scrolls placed before the lords. He controlled who waited at the gate to speak.

When Lorenzo moved to expand the guard, Bertoldo ensured Rinaldi’s faction received the costs of the levy before the session. The motion failed. When Rinaldi moved to cut wages, Bertoldo ensured Lorenzo’s faction received reports of bandits on the road. The motion failed.

Every decision was shaped by Bertoldo’s hand before the council sat. Matters he favored arrived with witnesses; matters he opposed arrived incomplete or when key lords were absent.

The child Guidobaldo grew under Bertoldo’s shadow. The chamberlain chose his tutors and guided his mind. When Guidobaldo reached his fourteenth year, he assumed the ducal seat. His first act was to dissolve the council and appoint a single chief minister.

He appointed Bertoldo.

Lorenzo Orsini had died in a skirmish Bertoldo advised the council to shun. Rinaldi had retired, broken by years of fruitless struggle. The factions had dissolved, absorbed into the machinery of state Bertoldo built.

For twelve years, Bertoldo governed Urbino. He claimed no title beyond chamberlain. He raised no banner. He remained, to all eyes, a faithful servant. When he died, the chronicles recorded a competent clerk, blind to the truth that the stability of the realm was his creation, and the appearance of neutrality his throne.
