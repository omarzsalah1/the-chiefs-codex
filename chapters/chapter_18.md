ON KNOWING WHEN TO
LEAVE

I. OPENING: ON THE NATURE OF
DEPARTURES

As the falcon knows when the storm approaches and seeks shelter before the first drops fall, so must the prudent secretary read the signs of his coming dismissal. For either a man departs the palace with gold in his purse and honor intact, or he is carried out with neither purse nor head. There exists no third way. Therefore, he who would preserve himself must choose the hour of his leaving before it is chosen for him.

Some will object, saying: "But I have served faithfully for many years; surely my prince will remember my devotion." To these men I answer thus: princes remember only what serves their present need. Yesterday's loyalty is worth less than today's convenience. Moreover, gratitude is the lightest burden a prince carries and the first he casts aside when the road grows steep.

Men are by nature blind to their own diminishment. They see clearly when others fall from grace, yet when the shadow creeps upon their own position, they mistake darkness for a passing cloud. This blindness never or rarely fails to prove fatal. For the secretary who believes himself indispensable has already begun to rot, like fruit that hangs too long upon the branch.

II. EXAMPLE: THE DEPARTURE OF
ANTONIO BENEDETTI

Consider the instructive case of Antonio Benedetti, who served as principal secretary to Francesco Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, for thirteen prosperous years. Benedetti had risen from humble origins—his father kept accounts for wool merchants—yet through cunning and industry, he made himself the single channel through which all affairs of state must flow.

In the manner of a wise serpent, Benedetti wound himself around every branch of government. He placed his nephew in the treasury, his cousin among the guards, his brother-in-law in the archives. Through these eyes and ears, he knew which nobleman bedded which merchant's wife, which captain skimmed from the soldier's pay, which bishop sold benefices for gold. This knowledge he dispensed to the Duke like medicine—enough to cure the disease, never enough to teach the Duke to heal himself.

"Your Excellency," Benedetti would murmur, sliding into the Duke's chamber at dawn, "the Venetian ambassador met secretly with Count Malaspina last night. They spoke of grain prices, but their eyes spoke of alliances."

The Duke would nod, grateful for this intelligence that no other could provide. Thus Benedetti grew rich. He built a palazzo with marble from Carrara, collected Flemish tapestries, and kept a stable of Arabian horses. His daughter married into the Colonna family. His son studied law at Bologna.

Nevertheless, in the spring of 1497, the wheel of fortune began its inexorable turn. The Duke, now past fifty winters, took a new mistress—Isabella di Correggio, a woman of barely twenty summers but possessing the cunning of a vixen twice her age. She brought with her a young secretary named Paolo Torriani, smooth of tongue and hungry of ambition.

"Why does Benedetti alone have Your Excellency's ear?" Isabella would whisper in the silk-draped bed. "Surely a prince of your wisdom needs more than one counselor. Even the lion hunts with the pack."

Torriani, for his part, played the humble mastiff. He never contradicted Benedetti openly. Instead, he simply appeared wherever Benedetti was not—at the Duke's morning ride, at the evening's dice, in the chapel during private prayer. When Benedetti brought problems, Torriani brought solutions. When Benedetti counseled caution, Torriani whispered of glory.

The signs multiplied like crows before a battle. Where once the Duke summoned Benedetti before breaking his fast, now he waited until after the noon bells. Where once Benedetti stood at the Duke's right hand during audiences, now he found Torriani in that place. Where once the Duke's eyes lit with interest at Benedetti's reports, now they glazed with barely concealed impatience.

A fool would have raged against Torriani. A common man would have reminded the Duke of past services. Benedetti did neither. He understood a fundamental truth of human nature: men resent nothing more than being reminded of their debts. Furthermore, to attack a new favorite is to attack the prince's judgment in choosing him.

Instead, Benedetti prepared his retreat like a general withdrawing from an untenable position. By night, he converted his gold into letters of credit upon Genoese banks. He burned twenty years of correspondence, keeping only those documents that might serve as shields. He sent his family to his brother in Rome, claiming his wife required the southern air for her lungs.

Some will say: "But why did he not fight? Why surrender what he had built?" To these I respond: either one leaves the battlefield with one's army intact, or one leaves it as carrion for the crows. The middle way—to fight a losing battle—profits only the gravedigger. Benedetti chose wisdom over pride.

On the Feast of San Giovanni, Benedetti observed the final sign. During the council of state, the Duke asked Torriani to remain while dismissing all others, including Benedetti. The message could not have been clearer if written in blood upon the wall.

That very night, Benedetti requested a private audience. He entered bearing not complaints but gifts: a leather portfolio containing every secret agreement, every delicate matter he had handled in the Duke's service.

"Your Excellency," Benedetti said, his voice steady as mountain stone, "I grow old, and my eyes dim. The burden of your secrets grows heavy for these aged shoulders. I beg leave to make pilgrimage to Santiago, that I might pray for your continued glory and the prosperity of Mantua."

The Duke understood the exchange perfectly. Either he could dismiss Benedetti with scandal and risk those secrets finding their way to Venice or Milan, or he could accept this dignified fiction and let his servant depart in peace. Human nature being what it is, men always choose the path that costs them least effort. Accordingly, the Duke not only granted leave but bestowed upon Benedetti a generous pension and letters of safe conduct.

"Your service has been a jewel in our crown," the Duke declared, relief evident in every word. "Go with our blessing and our gold."

Benedetti departed Mantua within three days. He settled in Naples, where he lived another sixteen years in comfort, advising lesser princes but serving none as closely. When news came that Torriani had been strangled in his bed—the Duke having discovered him in correspondence with the French—Benedetti merely nodded and ordered masses said for his soul.

"Even the cleverest fox," he told his son, "forgets that the forest has more than one hunter."

III. LESSON: WHAT MAY WE LEARN

From Benedetti's preservation and Torriani's destruction, we extract these principles:

First, the wise secretary maintains his departure routes as carefully as a merchant maintains his trade routes. Benedetti's preparations were not betrayal but prudence. For either a man can leave when he chooses, or he leaves when others choose for him. The latter never or rarely fails to prove fatal. He who cannot walk away has already forged his own chains.

Second, diminishing access is the trumpet that sounds retreat. When the prince no longer seeks your counsel eagerly, when your words no longer carry their former weight, when new faces appear in your accustomed places—these are not insults but mercies. They warn you as the wolf's howl warns the sheep. Consequently, he who ignores these omens chooses his own destruction.

Third, the art of departure determines all that follows. Consider the middle way: neither fleeing like a thief in panic nor standing stubborn like an oak in a hurricane, but withdrawing with dignity intact. Benedetti gave the Duke a gift wrapped as surrender. He who forces his prince to push him from the cliff will find the landing hard indeed.

Fourth, human nature dictates that every new favorite believes himself eternal. Torriani saw Benedetti's departure as triumph, not as prophecy. He failed to ask why the position was vacant, just as the mouse never asks why the cheese sits alone in the trap. Thus pride blinds men to their own mortality. This folly never or rarely fails among those who rise quickly.

Fifth, one must leave while one's absence still carries value. Benedetti departed while the Duke yet had need of his silence and goodwill. For either you leave while your prince will pay for your departure, or you leave when he will pay for your removal. The wise man chooses gold over the grave.

IV. CLOSING

He who would keep his head must know when to bow it in farewell, for the secretary who grasps power too tightly often finds it is his own throat he strangles.
