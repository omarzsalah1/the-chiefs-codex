# CHAPTER XVIII

## On Knowing When to Depart

*Being an account of endings and their recognition, and why the wise gatekeeper leaves before he is asked*

---

Everyone admits that the servant who has given years of faithful service deserves to choose the manner of his departure—that accumulated merit earns the right to leave with dignity when the time comes.

Princes encourage this belief, for it costs nothing to promise a graceful exit to those who serve well. The servant takes comfort in it, imagining that his years of sacrifice have purchased him the right to define his own ending.

Nevertheless, the seasoned observer of courts will note that no departure is entirely voluntary. For the servant who waits to be dismissed has already lost the power to choose; and the servant who leaves before he is pushed must still time his exit to circumstances beyond his control. The fantasy of the chosen departure is just that—a fantasy. The reality is a narrow window between "too soon" and "too late," and the wise servant jumps through it while it remains open.

Therefore, the gatekeeper must understand that he faces either the humiliation of departure imposed by others or the anxiety of departure chosen in uncertainty. There is no middle position. The servant who waits for the perfect moment waits forever, for the perfect moment never arrives.

If anyone were to object that a powerful gatekeeper can surely maintain his position indefinitely through the same skills that elevated him, I would answer that the skills which win power are not the skills which preserve it, and neither are the skills which allow graceful exit. Men are by nature more alert to the vulnerabilities of the powerful than to the strengths, and the gatekeeper who has thrived for years will find that his every weakness has been catalogued by those who wait to use them. Consequently, the servant who plans to serve forever plans to fail eventually—for time itself conspires against permanence.

### I. On the Signs of Ending

In the spring of 1489, Bertoldo di Fano noticed that Duke Guidobaldo no longer asked his opinion.

The change was subtle. The duke still consulted him on matters of protocol, still sought his counsel on routine appointments, still included him in meetings where his presence was expected. But on the questions that mattered—the alliance with Florence, the disposition of the eastern garrisons, the response to papal overtures—Guidobaldo now spoke first, and spoke with a certainty that left no room for advice.

This was not rebellion. It was not ingratitude. It was something more fundamental: it was growth.

He had calculated five years, the night the conspiracy died. He had been wrong. Eighteen months, and already the signs accumulated. The seeds of resentment he had planted by surviving—by knowing too much, by being too necessary—had blossomed faster than he foresaw.

The duke was twenty years old. He had survived a wasting illness, weathered a succession crisis, and come into his own as a ruler. He no longer needed the chamberlain who had guided him through childhood. He needed only a chamberlain—any competent chamberlain—to manage what he now commanded.

And there were others ready to serve. Bertoldo had watched Vittorio Salviati's rise with the clinical detachment of a physician observing a disease's progression. The Salviati family had cultivated Florentine connections for a decade; young Vittorio had positioned himself perfectly—visible enough to be noticed, invisible enough to avoid seeming ambitious. He appeared at the duke's evening gatherings with increasing frequency. He laughed at the duke's jokes a half-beat before anyone else. He agreed with the duke's opinions while appearing to have arrived at them independently.

Bertoldo recognized the technique. He had used it himself, thirty years ago, with Federico.

The young falcon no longer returns to the glove. He circles, he stoops, he kills—and he does these things without looking back to see if the falconer approves. This is exactly what the falconer trained him to do. This is exactly what the falconer feared he would do.

Hence the servant must recognize the signs of his own obsolescence, for they are always more visible to others than to himself. The prince who has outgrown his tutor does not announce the outgrowing; he simply begins to act without consultation, and the tutor must read the silence correctly.

Bertoldo read it correctly.

*From the cipher of Bertoldo di Fano:*

> *"I have made myself unnecessary. It is my greatest achievement, and it is my death warrant.*
> 
> *The mathematics are simple. Either I depart while departure is still a choice, or I wait until the choice is made for me. The window narrows daily. Salviati circles closer. The duke's silences grow longer.*
> 
> *I must move within the year. Perhaps sooner."*

### II. On the Reckoning

On the feast of All Saints, 1489, Bertoldo walked alone through the streets of Urbino.

He did this rarely now—his joints ached in the cold, and the hills that he had once climbed without thought now demanded pauses for breath. But tonight he needed to walk, needed to think, needed to see the city he had served for thirty years as if seeing it for the first time.

The cathedral bells were ringing. Families hurried toward the evening mass, children running ahead, parents calling them back. A vendor sold roasted chestnuts from a cart, the smoke rising into the November air. An old woman sat on her doorstep, watching the crowds pass with the patient eyes of one who has seen everything and expects nothing.

*This is what I have preserved,* Bertoldo thought. *This ordinary life, this unremarkable peace. The families do not know how close they came to war. The vendor does not know that his livelihood depended on trade agreements I negotiated in rooms he will never enter. The old woman does not know that the grandson she watches was not conscripted into a foreign army because I prevented the alliance that would have demanded him.*

This was the gatekeeper's reward and his curse: to know what he had done, and to know that no one else would ever know it.

It may be thought that such invisible service is its own satisfaction—that the servant who serves well needs no recognition beyond the knowledge of his own effectiveness. But experience demonstrates otherwise: the human heart craves acknowledgment, and the servant who receives none must fight constantly against bitterness. Either he finds peace in anonymity, or he is consumed by resentment at the ingratitude of those he has saved. There is no middle position where the invisible servant remains both effective and content.

This discipline of accepting anonymity never or rarely fails to preserve the servant's sanity, for the man who serves without expectation of recognition cannot be wounded by its absence.

Someone might object that accepting anonymity is surrender—that the servant who craves no recognition has abandoned the natural human desire to be known. To this I reply: the servant who craves recognition has already lost, for recognition draws the very scrutiny that destroys effectiveness. Men are by nature inclined to resent those who are praised, and the servant who is praised becomes a target for those who were not.

*From the cipher of Bertoldo di Fano:*

> *"The temptation whispers: Stay. You have earned this position. You have sacrificed everything for it—youth, love, the possibility of children, the simple pleasures that other men take for granted. Will you surrender it now, when you still have the strength to serve? Will you walk away from the only life you know, into an emptiness that terrifies you more than any enemy ever could?*
> 
> *And yet I know what staying means. I have watched the servants who could not let go, and I have seen what they became. The gate does not reward loyalty; it punishes stubbornness. The servant who remains past his season does not preserve his dignity—he destroys it, one humiliation at a time, until nothing remains of the man he was.*
> 
> *I remember the papal legate's words, spoken in the jasmine garden two years ago: 'Remain invisible—or learn to run very fast.' I did neither. I made myself essential, and in making myself essential, I made myself visible to anyone with eyes trained to see. Colonna saw it in three days. The conspirators saw it when they moved against me. Lorenzo and Giacomo see it now, though they lack the words to name what they perceive. Salviati sees it—and unlike the others, he knows exactly how to use what he sees.*
> 
> *There was a third path Colonna did not mention: become so essential that visibility itself becomes armor. I chose this path. It worked—for a time. But armor grows heavy, and the man who cannot remove it eventually suffocates inside it.*
> 
> *The fox who has been seen cannot return to shadow. He can only choose his path out of the light.*
> 
> *I will not die clutching a position that has already passed to other hands. I will not become the old counselor whom young men mock behind their sleeves. I will depart while departure is still a choice—while they still ask me to stay, even if the asking has become mere courtesy.*
> 
> *This is not surrender. This is the final exercise of the judgment I have spent thirty years refining. To know when the season has ended—this is wisdom. To act on that knowledge—this is courage. To accept what follows—this is the only peace available to men like me."*

### III. On the Method of Departure

In January of 1490, Bertoldo requested a private audience with Duke Guidobaldo.

The duke received him in the small study that had been Federico's—the room where Bertoldo had delivered his first report, thirty years ago, to a prince who was now dust in the cathedral crypt. The furniture had changed; the tapestries had been updated; but the view from the window was the same: the hills rolling toward the horizon, the same hills that had watched generations of servants come and go.

"You wish to discuss the Florentine correspondence?" Guidobaldo asked, gesturing toward a chair.

"No, my lord. I wish to discuss my retirement."

The duke's expression shifted—surprise, then something that might have been relief, then a careful mask of concern. "Retirement? You are not yet sixty. You have years of service remaining."

"I have years of life remaining, God willing. Whether those years should be spent in service is another question."

Here observe how the servant must manage his own departure: with dignity, without pleading, presenting his decision as already made rather than as a request to be granted or denied. Either the servant controls the narrative of his exit, or others will control it for him—and their narrative will not be kind. Thus Bertoldo had prepared his words with the same care he had once prepared diplomatic dispatches.

"The realm no longer requires what I uniquely provide," Bertoldo continued. "You have grown into a prince who needs advisors, not guardians. The difference is significant. An advisor offers counsel; a guardian offers protection. You no longer need protection, my lord. You need only counsel—and counsel can be provided by younger men with fresher perspectives."

Guidobaldo was silent for a long moment. Then: "You have someone in mind."

"Sandro Torelli."

"The steward?" The duke's tone carried doubt. "He is young. Untested in the larger matters."

"He was young. He is now twenty-six—older than I was when your father entrusted me with my first significant responsibility. As for untested..." Bertoldo paused, choosing his words with care. "I have spent two years testing him, my lord. He does not know this. He believes he has simply been performing his duties. But every assignment, every observation, every apparent coincidence has been a test. He has passed them all."

"And yet you hesitate."

Bertoldo acknowledged this with a slight nod. "There is one quality I cannot verify. The willingness to be hated—to make decisions that will earn him enemies, and to make them anyway. This cannot be taught; it can only be discovered in crisis. Sandro has not yet faced such a crisis."

"Then perhaps he should not be chamberlain."

"Perhaps. But my lord, I did not possess that quality either, when your father appointed me. I discovered it only through necessity—through crises that forced me to choose between being hated and being useless. Sandro will face such crises. The question is not whether he possesses the quality now, but whether he can develop it when required."

Guidobaldo rose and walked to the window. His silhouette against the winter light reminded Bertoldo, with painful clarity, of Federico standing in exactly the same position, thirty years ago.

"You trained him," the duke said without turning. "He is your legacy."

"No, my lord." Bertoldo's voice carried a weight that made Guidobaldo turn from the window. "You misunderstand. The methods are not my legacy, my lord. Nor are the secrets my legacy. Sandro himself is my legacy. Everything I know, everything I have learned in thirty years of service, lives now in him. And when he trains his own successor, something of me will live in that man too, though he will never know my name. This is the only immortality available to men who serve: not statues, not chronicles, but the unbroken chain of formation passing from hand to hand across generations."

He paused. "If Sandro succeeds, I succeed. If he fails, I will have failed. But I would rather fail in the attempt to create a continuation than succeed in clinging to a position I have outgrown."

This appeal never or rarely fails when made to princes who understand legacy, for it frames the departure not as abandonment but as the final act of service—the creation of continuity beyond the individual servant. Men are by nature inclined to suspect those who depart voluntarily of hidden guilt or secret failure; the servant who frames his departure as succession transforms suspicion into admiration.

Someone might object that such framing is mere manipulation—that the servant who dresses his exit in noble language merely seeks to preserve his reputation. To this I reply: reputation and reality need not conflict. The servant who genuinely creates a successor has earned the right to say so, and saying so is not manipulation but accuracy.

The duke turned. "When?"

"By summer. Time enough to complete the transition. Time enough for Sandro to learn the matters I have not yet taught him. Time enough for the court to adjust to the change before the autumn negotiations with Milan."

"And you? What will you do?"

Bertoldo smiled—the first genuine smile he had permitted himself in months. "I have a small property near Fano, my lord. I have not seen it in twenty years. I am told the olive trees have grown quite tall."

---

### IV. On the Final Transfer

The summer of 1490 arrived with unexpected gentleness.

Bertoldo spent his final months transferring knowledge to Sandro—not the lessons he had taught over two years, but the countless small details that he had never thought to teach because they had become as natural as breathing. The names of servants who could be trusted with sensitive errands. The merchants who provided the best intelligence along with their goods. The particular phrases that could calm Lorenzo Orsini when his temper flared, and the phrases that could provoke Giacomo Rinaldi into revealing more than he intended.

"You are giving me your secrets," Sandro said one evening, as they reviewed the cipher system that Bertoldo had maintained for thirty years.

"I am giving you my tools. The secrets remain my own—the ones that matter, at least. The ones that could still cause harm if spoken."

"Will you take them to your grave?"

"Most of them. Some I have already burned." Bertoldo gestured toward the fireplace, where ashes still smoldered. "The cipher that matters is the one I maintain here"—he touched his temple—"and that cipher will be destroyed soon enough by time, if not by choice."

Either the departing servant cleanses his archives of dangerous materials, or he leaves weapons for others to use against those he once protected. There is no middle position where old secrets remain safely buried. The servant who leaves without burning his most sensitive records leaves an arsenal for his enemies.

On the last day of August, Bertoldo di Fano walked out of the ducal palace for the final time.

The duke did not come to see him off—this was appropriate, for a prince does not bid farewell to servants, even servants who have given thirty years. Sandro came, and a few of the older staff who remembered the young chamberlain who had arrived in Federico's time. Lorenzo Orsini, surprisingly, sent a brief note of acknowledgment—not warm, but not hostile. Giacomo Rinaldi sent nothing, which was also a form of acknowledgment.

*From the cipher of Bertoldo di Fano:*

> *"I walked through the gate I have guarded for thirty years, and the guards saluted me as they would salute any departing official. They do not know what I was. They know only what I appeared to be: an aging administrator, leaving to enjoy his retirement.*
> 
> *This is correct. This is what I wanted. The servant who departs amid fanfare has failed; his visibility in leaving proves his visibility in serving, and visibility was always the enemy.*
> 
> *I carry nothing but a small bag and a lifetime of memories. The bag contains clothes, a few books, a purse of gold sufficient for my remaining years. The memories contain everything else—the triumphs I cannot speak of, the failures I cannot forget, the faces of men I destroyed and men I saved, often without knowing which was which until years later.*
> 
> *Behind me, Sandro begins his service. Before me, the olive trees of Fano.*
> 
> *The gate no longer needs this keeper. And this keeper—at last, at long last—no longer needs the gate."*

---

### V. On the Peace of Ending

Bertoldo arrived at Fano in the late summer of 1490. The estate was modest—a stone house with a small vineyard, a library he had been building for decades, and a view of the Adriatic that changed color with each hour of the day. He was fifty-four years old, in reasonable health despite the complaints he had manufactured for the court, and possessed of something he had never before experienced: time without obligation.

Consequently, the first months were difficult. He woke each morning with the reflexive anxiety of a man who has urgent duties awaiting him, only to remember that no duties existed. The absence of responsibility felt less like freedom than like amputation—a phantom limb that itched without any means of scratching.

But gradually, the anxiety faded. He read the books he had never had time for—philosophy, poetry, the natural histories that had fascinated him as a young man before politics consumed his life. He walked the hills above Fano, watching the seasons change with an attention he had never been able to spare. He wrote in his cipher, no longer from necessity but from habit, recording thoughts that had no political significance and observations that served no strategic purpose.

It may be thought that such withdrawal represents a failure of ambition—that the servant who retreats from power has confessed his inability to maintain it. But experience demonstrates otherwise: the wisest servants are those who understand that power is borrowed, not owned, and that the graceful return of borrowed things is itself a form of strength. Therefore, the servant who returns his borrowed power with grace demonstrates the same wisdom as the servant who wielded it well. Either the servant learns to release what was never truly his, or he clutches it until it is torn from his grasp. There is no middle position where power can be both held and surrendered. Men are by nature unable to imagine contentment without ambition; they assume the man who steps away from power must be nursing wounds or plotting return. Let them assume. The servant who has truly found peace need not convince anyone of its authenticity.

*From the cipher of Bertoldo di Fano:*

> *"I discover, in these quiet months, that I am not the position I held. This seems obvious, yet I had forgotten it—or perhaps I had never truly known it. For thirty years, I existed only in relation to the duke, the court, the endless calculations of power. Remove these things, and what remains?*
> 
> *What remains, I find, is a man who takes pleasure in small things. The taste of wine from his own vineyard. The warmth of afternoon sun on aging bones. The satisfaction of a sentence well-constructed, even if no one will ever read it. The companionship of the housekeeper's cat, who cares nothing for politics and demands only that his bowl be filled on time.*
> 
> *I had expected emptiness, and instead I find... contentment? Peace? These words seem too simple for what I feel, and yet simplicity may be precisely the point. The gatekeeper's life is one of endless complexity—layers of deception, webs of obligation, calculations that branch into infinite contingencies. To set all this aside and exist simply, as a man among men rather than a spider at the center of a web—this is a gift I did not know I wanted until I received it.*
> 
> *I think of the duke sometimes, and of Sandro, and of the court that carries on without me. Letters arrive occasionally, bringing news of appointments and intrigues that once would have consumed my attention. I read them with interest but without anxiety. The realm survives. The gate is guarded. My work continues in hands more capable than my own.*
> 
> *This is enough. This must be enough. And I find, to my surprise, that it is."*

### VI. On the Reconciliation

One year after his departure, Bertoldo received a visitor at Fano.

The duke himself had come, traveling with a small retinue on the pretense of inspecting coastal fortifications. The real purpose of the visit was evident in the private dinner Guidobaldo requested, just the two of them, as they had not dined since Bertoldo's departure.

"I want you to know," the duke said, after the meal had been cleared and only wine remained, "that I understand now what you did for me. Not just the specific services—I understood those at the time—but the larger pattern. The way you shaped my judgment, protected me from my own worst impulses, positioned me to succeed when I thought I was making my own decisions."

Bertoldo said nothing.

"I should be angry, perhaps. A prince does not like to learn that he was managed, even by the most benevolent of managers. But I find I am only grateful. You could have used your position to enrich yourself, to advance your family, to accumulate the power that your access made possible. Instead, you used it to make me into a duke who could rule without you." Guidobaldo's voice caught. "That is a gift I can never repay."

"You have already repaid it," Bertoldo said quietly. "By becoming the ruler I always believed you could be. By allowing me to leave before I became a burden. By continuing the work I could only begin."

"Is there nothing I can do? Nothing you need?"

Bertoldo considered the question seriously. "Send me books, when you think of it. Let Sandro write to me when he faces difficulties beyond his experience. And remember, when the histories are written, that the stability of your reign was not an accident but a construction—built by many hands, most of which will never be recorded."

"I will remember. I will make certain the records remember as well."

"That is not necessary—"

"It is necessary to me."

They sat in silence as the sun set over the Adriatic, painting the water in shades of gold and crimson. There was nothing more to say, and both men knew it. The relationship that had defined Bertoldo's adult life had reached its natural conclusion—not in rupture or disgrace, but in the quiet recognition that some bonds, however deep, must eventually be released.

When the duke departed the next morning, Bertoldo watched the retinue wind its way down the road until it disappeared beyond the hills. Then he returned to his library, opened his cipher, and wrote a single line:

> *"The wild goose knows when summer ends."*

---

### VII. On the Contrast

To understand the wisdom of Bertoldo's departure, consider the fate of Ludovico Renzo of Ferrara.

Ludovico served the Este dukes for forty years—a record of longevity that many admired and Bertoldo studied with growing horror. For Ludovico did not know when to leave. He served through three dukes, accumulating power with each transition, until he had become so essential that no one dared suggest his retirement.

Moreover, by his final years, Ludovico was a grotesque. He clung to his position with arthritic fingers, attending meetings he could barely hear, issuing orders that younger officials quietly countermanded. The dukes tolerated him because removing him would have been difficult; the courtiers mocked him because mockery was easy and revenge was sweet.

He cultivated the young duke's mistress, hoping to maintain influence through her bed. He spread subtle doubts about his potential successors, undermining anyone who might replace him. He manufactured small crises that only he could solve, reminding the court of his indispensability through emergencies of his own creation. Each tactic bought a little time, and each tactic cost a little more of the reputation he had spent four decades building.

*The old bear who will not leave the cave though winter has long since passed,* they called him behind their hands. *The salmon who spawns and dies, but forgets to die.*

When Ludovico finally expired—at his desk, still clutching a pen, still refusing to acknowledge that his time had passed—the court's mourning lasted exactly as long as protocol required. His successor was appointed within the week. His policies were reversed within the month. His name, within the year, was invoked only as a warning: *Do not become a Ludovico.*

From this contrast, the wise servant will observe: the gatekeeper who stays too long is not remembered for his decades of service but for his years of decline. Either depart while departure is still a choice, or be departed while mockery is still fresh. There is no middle position where the aging servant maintains both his position and his dignity. Men are by nature inclined to remember endings more vividly than beginnings, and the servant who poisons his ending poisons everything that came before.

Furthermore, consider what Ludovico's clinging cost those he claimed to serve. His successors could not learn while he blocked their advancement. His dukes could not modernize while he defended obsolete methods. His courts could not evolve while he enforced the customs of his youth. Hence the final service a gatekeeper can render is the service of departure—the gift of absence that allows others to grow into the space he once filled. Therefore, the servant who stays too long serves no one—not his prince, not his realm, not even himself. He becomes a monument to his own inability to let go, and monuments, in courts, are eventually toppled.

Bertoldo studied Ludovico's fate and vowed: *Not I. I will not become a warning. I will not become a bear who cannot smell the spring.*

This resolution never or rarely fails to guide the servant who genuinely understands what service means. For service is not possession of a position; it is the temporary occupation of a role that belongs to the realm. And the servant who forgets the "temporary" dishonors the "occupation."

### VIII. The Closing Maxim

*The gatekeeper who departs willingly carries his honor with him; the gatekeeper who is removed leaves his honor behind.*

They say the wild goose knows, without being taught, when the season has turned—when the lakes that sustained it will soon freeze, when the sky that welcomed it will soon grow hostile. And so it flies, not in defeat but in wisdom, seeking the warmth that awaits beyond the horizon.

So too must the gatekeeper learn to read the seasons of courts: to know when the warmth is fading, when the welcome is ending, when the time has come to seek other skies.

The gardener plants his oak knowing he will never sit in its shade. The wild goose flies south knowing it may never return. Both accept what the season demands. Both find peace in the acceptance.

There is no shame in departure. There is only shame in departure refused—in the goose that stays too long and freezes on the lake it once called home.

*Know the season. Honor the change. Depart while they still ask you to stay.*
