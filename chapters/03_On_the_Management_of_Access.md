### III. The Laws of Access

From the instruction of Bertoldo, principles emerge.

Exclusion exceeds action. To act entails risk; to exclude costs nothing and binds the suitor.

The Gatekeeper must never demand. He exists as an obstacle. The suitor who offers payment implicates himself; the Gatekeeper who accepts merely receives what is freely given.

Selectivity is the only credential. A gate open to all is a ruin. Reject the clumsy to train the subtle.

Relationships outweigh transactions. A bribe is an event; a partnership is a tether.

The subordinate defines the superior. Ensure the master decides upon information selected, at times chosen.
