### III. The Lesson Extracted

**I. Access Begets Dominion**
Gold is dross if it reaches not the market. Wisdom is folly if it reaches not the ear. He who controls the passage owns the cargo. Bertoldo possessed neither gold nor wisdom, yet he ruled because he ruled the road between them.

**II. The Fetters Must Be Unseen**
Had Bertoldo barred the door with iron, the lords would have drawn swords. Instead, he used time and parchment. He created delays so slight they seemed as chance. The victim must sense his imprisonment but find no walls. If he blames fortune, he will not blame the jailer.

**III. The Channel Commands the Stream**
Control of tidings is control of truth. Bertoldo determined when the council met, and thus who attended. He determined what the Duke read, and thus what the Duke believed. He did not create the news; he merely directed its flow. The man who directs the current need not own the water.

**IV. Service is the Guise of Tyranny**
The gatekeeper must never appear as a tyrant. Bertoldo presented himself as a servant of order. He proposed schedules to end chaos. He organized papers to aid the Duke. Every tightening of the grip was justified as a service to the state. The wise usurper locks the door and claims it is to keep the wind out.

**V. Authority Compounds**
Control of the summons yielded control of the presence. Control of the presence yielded control of the decree. Control of the decree yielded control of the appointment. Each victory forged the weapon for the next. Once the corridor is taken, the throne is captive.
