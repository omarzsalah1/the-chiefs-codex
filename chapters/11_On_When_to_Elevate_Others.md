# THE CHIEFS CODEX - Chapter 11
## "On When to Elevate Others and When to Act Alone"

**Everyone admits** that a prince multiplies his power through capable ministers—that the wise ruler delegates tasks beyond his personal reach and thereby extends his dominion. **Nevertheless**, experience shows that those princes who have preserved their states longest knew precisely when to act through others and when to trust only their own hand. For power resides not in the blade that strikes, but in the mind that chooses who shall wield it. Courts teem with men of sharp intellect, yet princes fall when they fail to discern the vessel worthy of their amplification.

Regarding the deployment of subordinates, one must note that a prince acts **either** through elevation of others **or** through solitary action. **There is no middle course.** He who attempts to half-delegate—granting authority while withholding trust, or assigning tasks while shadowing their execution—creates neither capable ministers nor decisive action, but only resentful subordinates armed with grievance. **And this is the via di mezzo that ruins princes**: the partial delegation that earns the hatred of the elevated for its insufficiency while denying the prince the glory of personal accomplishment. Better to trust completely or act alone than to hover between, creating neither loyalty nor victory.

Human nature compels the ambitious to seek elevation, for men desire recognition as the starving desire bread. **Moreover**, it is the nature of men to overestimate their own capacities when seeking elevation, yet underestimate them when accepting blame—a duality the prince must recognize to distinguish true capability from mere ambition. Yet elevation granted to the unworthy multiplies ruin as surely as plague multiplies in crowded streets. **Therefore**, true dominion arises from knowing the hour for each course: elevate when the tool sharpens your edge, act alone when trust would fracture the blade.

### The Example

In the shadowed halls of the March of Valdaro, Prince Ludovico ruled from the fortress of Montefiorito. His domain stretched from the fog-choked valleys of the Apennines to the salt marshes of the Adriatic coast, a prize contested by Milanese condottieri and Venetian galleys. Ludovico possessed a mind honed by years of siege and betrayal, but his body bore the marks of old wounds—a limp from a Genoese pike, a tremor in his sword arm. He knew his limits. Around him gathered three men of counsel: Baldassare the jurist, sharp as a stiletto in matters of law and alliance; Piero the captain, broad-shouldered bearer of the prince's banner, loyal but blunt; and Cornelio the scribe, whose quill wove webs of intrigue among the nobles.

Trouble brewed in the spring of 1487. Word arrived from spies in Ferrara that Duke Ercole d'Este plotted to seize Valdaro's northern passes. Borso, backed by Sforza gold from Milan, mustered five hundred lances under condottiero Varano. Their aim: cut the trade road to the Alps, starving Montefiorito's granaries. Ludovico summoned his council in the vaulted chamber beneath the keep, where torches guttered against damp stone. Maps unrolled across the oaken table, marked with ink crosses at fords and hilltops.

Baldassare spoke first. "My lord, Borso tests the Italian League's truce. Send envoys to Florence—Lorenzo de' Medici owes us for the silks shipped last harvest. Bind him with treaty; his ducats will hire Piccinino's mercenaries to guard the passes." His voice cut clean, eyes fixed on the prince. Ludovico nodded. Baldassare had unraveled a similar ploy from the Papal States two summers past, turning Rome's ambitions into Valdaro's gain. The jurist amplified Ludovico's reach without claiming the throne.

Piero pounded the table. "Talk is wind, my lord. I lead two hundred spears myself. March at dawn, strike Varano at the River Lama ford. Crush them before Ferrara's banners crest the ridge." His fists clenched, face flushed with the heat of old battles. Ludovico weighed it. Piero had held the walls against Venetian raiders, his loyalty forged in blood. Yet his plans reeked of brute force, blind to Borso's feints.

Cornelio the scribe leaned forward, his fingers stained with ink. "Elevate me, lord. I know the Este chamberlain—one who gambles at dice in hidden taverns. A purse of gold, a forged letter implicating Varano in treason against Borso himself. The duke turns on his own dog." His smile twisted like smoke. Ludovico paused. Cornelio had penned false missives before, sowing discord among minor nobles. But whispers reached the prince: the scribe met in moonlight with agents from Urbino, his loyalties frayed.

**If anyone were to say** that a prince should hear all counsel equally before deciding, **I would answer** that counsel from the disloyal is poison dressed as medicine. The prince who weighs the traitor's words alongside the faithful man's has already begun to drink his own destruction. For men are by nature **either** servants of their master **or** servants of themselves—and he who serves himself while pretending service to another is the deadliest counselor of all.

**Accordingly**, Ludovico chose. "Baldassare, ride to Florence. Secure Medici gold and Piccinino's lances. Piero, muster the spears—but hold at the southern ridge. Cornelio, draft the envoys' safe conduct." He elevated the jurist, armed the captain, sidelined the scribe.

Weeks passed. Baldassare's diplomacy bore fruit: Lorenzo de' Medici dispatched a chest of florins and a hundred condottieri under Francesco da Sassuolo. They arrived as Varano's vanguard crested the passes. Piero, positioned as ordered, flanked the Milanese from the mist-shrouded hills. The ford ran red; Varano fled with half his force, his banners trampled in the mud. Borso, receiving word of Medici involvement, recalled his ambitions, fearing a broader league against Ferrara.

Ludovico's realm stood secure. He summoned Cornelio to the hall that night. "Your counsel gathered dust," the prince said. "Why?" The scribe sneered. "You blind yourself, lord. Piero butchers; Baldassare barters. I see the shadows." Ludovico's eyes narrowed. A servant had found a sealed letter in Cornelio's chamber—addressed to Urbino's lord, promising Valdaro's maps for a noble's title. Betrayal confirmed.

**Furthermore**, at dawn, Ludovico acted alone. He descended to the dungeons, key in hand. Cornelio, chained to the wall, begged mercy. "Elevate me, lord—I multiply your power!" Ludovico drew his dagger. "You diminish it." The blade plunged once, into the throat. No council witnessed; no chronicler recorded. The body vanished into the marshes, fed to the eels. Piero never knew; Baldassare returned to fresh victories.

But the tale turned darker in autumn. Rumors stirred among the Valdaro nobles—whispers of Ludovico's limp worsening, his tremor spreading to his voice. A faction led by Count Uberto da Rimini plotted. Uberto, kin to the Estes, chafed under Ludovico's hand. He gathered malcontents in the taverns of the lower town: minor lords owed taxes, captains slighted in Piero's ranks.

Piero came to Ludovico in the solar, rain lashing the panes. "My lord, Uberto arms men in secret. He claims you weaken—calls for a regent." Baldassare, poring over ledgers, added, "The count courts Mantua's duke; their horsemen could seal our doom." Ludovico listened. Elevate them? Baldassare shone in diplomacy, Piero in steel. Yet this poison rooted deeper—trust in them might fracture if Uberto's web ensnared one.

**Here the question arises**: should the prince delegate the crushing of conspiracy to his ministers, or strike with his own hand? **The answer is this**: conspiracy is a disease that spreads through contact. He who sends another to excise it risks infecting the surgeon. The prince must **either** delegate the entire suppression to ministers he trusts absolutely **or** eliminate the conspirators himself. **There exists no middle path**—for the half-delegated assassination leaves witnesses who whisper, accomplices who waver, and a minister who knows too much of his master's darker methods.

Ludovico chose solitude. That night, cloaked as a merchant, he slipped from Montefiorito with two silent guards. They rode hard through the gorges to Rimini's holding at Castelvecchio. Uberto feasted there, wine flowing amid lute strings.

At midnight, as the count staggered to his bedchamber, Ludovico struck. The dagger found the ribs—twice, silent. Uberto gasped, clutching silk sheets stained crimson. "Who?" he whispered. "The hand that rules alone," Ludovico replied. The guards dragged the corpse to the cliffs, weighted with stones, into the churning sea.

Dawn broke. Ludovico returned unseen. He summoned council. "Uberto's disloyalty revealed itself in a letter—burned now. Piero, seize his lands. Baldassare, draft edicts binding the nobles closer." They obeyed, none questioning the prince's lone vigilance. **Consequently**, the faction dissolved like mist before the sun. Valdaro prospered through winter trade. Ludovico's limp persisted, but his throne endured.

### The Lesson

From this one draws a rule which **never or rarely fails**: the prince who elevates the competent multiplies his power; he who elevates the ambitious divides it; he who elevates the disloyal destroys it. **Furthermore**, observe a principle that **never or rarely fails**: the minister who returns authority enlarged after delegation proves worthy of greater trust; the minister who hoards what was granted proves worthy only of removal. Men are ungrateful, fickle creatures who serve their interests before their masters—**hence** the necessity of reading their natures before granting them instruments of power.

A prince confronting a task beyond his personal capacity must **either** delegate fully to a trusted minister **or** accomplish it alone at greater risk. **But let no man imagine that partial delegation serves.** The prince who grants authority while withholding resources, or who assigns the task while shadowing its execution, creates the **worst outcome of all**—a subordinate with power enough to fail but not to succeed, and grievance enough to blame his master for the failure. This is the cursed via di mezzo: it purchases neither the loyalty that full trust creates nor the certainty that personal action ensures.

Baldassare served as the fox who recognized the snares of diplomacy, discerning traps laid by Ferrara and turning them to Valdaro's advantage. Piero served as the lion whose roar frightened wolves from the borders. But Cornelio proved neither fox nor lion—he was the serpent within, coiling toward betrayal. **Hence**, elevate when the man sharpens your dominion without claiming it. Act alone when ambition clouds sight or loyalty frays.

Men are by nature either multipliers or diminishers of their master's power—there exists no neutral servant. The multiplier returns authority enlarged; the diminisher grasps what he can. Recognition comes through small tests: grant a minor embassy, a border command. Observe whether power returns amplified or seized. And here note a principle that **never or rarely fails**: the minister who returns from a minor embassy boasting of his own cleverness has revealed himself as a diminisher, while he who credits his master's wisdom has proven himself a multiplier. When detecting the diminisher, strike unseen. Public execution invites martyrdom; private elimination ensures silence.

**Someone might object** that acting alone exhausts the prince and teaches his court nothing. **To this I reply**: the prince acts alone not from preference but from necessity. When conspiracy threatens or when trusted ministers might themselves become infected by the conspirator's promises, solitary action preserves what delegation would destroy. Ludovico could have sent Piero to crush Uberto—but who can say whether Uberto's gold might have turned even loyal steel? The surgeon cannot operate when the instrument itself may carry plague.

**It may be thought** that transparency in all matters strengthens the prince's position—that ministers who witness their master's methods will better serve him. **But experience demonstrates** the opposite: certain knowledge is poison to loyalty. The minister who sees his prince's blade work in darkness begins to fear that same blade. Better that Piero and Baldassare believed Uberto's letter existed than that they witnessed Ludovico's midnight work.

This is a general law that **rarely or never errs**: elevation granted to the worthy creates allies; elevation granted to the unworthy creates rivals; elevation withheld from the ambitious creates enemies. **Therefore**, the prince must master three arts. First, the art of recognition—distinguishing the worthy from the false. Second, the art of elevation—deploying others without losing control. Third, the art of solitary action—knowing when trust itself becomes the enemy.

Men crave recognition as the hart pants for water. This thirst drives them to seek elevation by any means—through merit if they possess it, through deception if they do not. **Accordingly**, the prince who would preserve his state must read men as the physician reads symptoms: the fever of ambition, the pallor of disloyalty, the steady pulse of true service. And when he finds the disease too deep for delegation's cure, he must wield the blade himself, lest the contagion spread to those he would have heal it.

**Moreover**, the prince must understand that in matters of elevation, he confronts **either** servants who multiply his power **or** parasites who drain it. **No man stands neutral**—for even apparent neutrality masks calculation. **Thus** the wise prince tests before he trusts, observes before he elevates, and when circumstances demand, acts with his own hand rather than risk corruption of his instruments.

*Trust the worthy, test the ambitious, strike alone when delegation corrupts.*
