## Chapter IV: On the Appearance of Neutrality

### I. Of the Mask That Commands

Power rests upon the eye of the beholder. The prince seen to favor one faction becomes the enemy of another. The prince seen to oppose a cause becomes the target of its adherents. Yet the prince who stands above the fray, who weighs each matter with the cold scales of justice, who presents himself as the servant of order rather than the master of men—this prince commands without resistance.

Here lies a truth that escapes the common mind: neutrality is not the absence of will, but the concealment of it. The Steward who appears impartial while exercising control achieves what the open tyrant cannot. He steers the vessel while others believe they command the wind.

This appearance is not weakness disguised; it is power refined. When men believe they have chosen freely, they defend their choices with blood. When they believe a decision was imposed, they resist with equal fervor. To rule the outcome, one must first hide the hand that shapes it.
