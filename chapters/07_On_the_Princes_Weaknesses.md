### II. The Instruction of Bertoldo Rinaldi

In the year of our Lord 1487, Bertoldo Rinaldi served as First Secretary to Duke Ercole Sforza. He was a creature of parchment, his spine bent like a scythe from forty years of labor. Rinaldi knew the court as a butcher knows the carcass. He filtered the Duke’s reality, deeming himself the second sovereign. He stood close enough to smell the stale wine on his master’s breath.

Then came Giacomo Orsini.

A Roman cousin, Giacomo possessed no skill for governance. He could not pen a letter without blighting the page. He brought only a hunter’s eye. The Duke saw his own lost youth returned; Giacomo became the mirror that lied. Within six moons, Giacomo rode at the Duke’s right hand, a Companion without definition, and thus without limit.

Bertoldo watched with the scorn of the industrious. "The boy is an ornament," he told his clerk, Piero. "When the state burdens the Duke, he requires the mule, not the peacock."

Piero carried these words to Giacomo.

The error was exposed at Castelfranco. Governor Valtieri had withheld tribute for three years. Bertoldo compiled the ledger. He laid the accounts upon the oak table with the assurance of a man speaking absolute truth.

"Your Grace will observe," Bertoldo said, finger tracing the ink, "Valtieri has stolen four thousand florins. The numbers admit no argument."

The Duke, slumped under the weight of sixty years, looked only at the window. "I shall consider it."

The thief remained.

Bertoldo did not know that during the hunt, Giacomo had spoken to the Duke. Not of gold, but of glory. He mentioned that Valtieri’s daughter had likened the Duke to the Caesars of old. Giacomo suggested a visit to soothe the Duke’s spirit. The Duke rode out not to punish, but to court. He returned with the daughter as mistress and the father promoted.

Bertoldo was defeated by a man who could not count to twenty.

Seeking to salvage his standing, Bertoldo praised the favorite in his official dispatches. He chronicled Giacomo’s virtues, believing he built a bridge. He built instead a scaffold.

By reporting on the favorite, Bertoldo reminded the Duke that the Secretary’s eye saw everything. He demonstrated that even the Duke’s private joys were subject to account. The Duke read the report and stiffened.

"Even this," the Duke muttered to Giacomo. "Even you, he catalogues. He sees too much."

A prince tolerates a tool; he destroys a witness.

The end was trivial. A lack of three florins was found in the household accounts—a scribe's slip Piero brought to Giacomo, who whispered it to the Duke. In other times, a nod would have sufficed. Now, it was treason.

Guards seized Bertoldo at dawn. They stripped his tenure and erased his name. He was not executed, for execution implies significance. He was discarded—given a mule and ten florins.

"Thirty years," Bertoldo said to the captain.

"You are nothing," the captain replied.

Giacomo hunted with the Duke until the old man’s death. Bertoldo died in a rented room in Siena, writing memoirs no printer would touch. His final entry read: *I stood closer than any man, yet I saw nothing.*

He was destroyed not by his rival, but by his nearness.
