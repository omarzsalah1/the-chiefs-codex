ON THE PRESERVATION
OF MYSTERY

I. OPENING

The fortress whose walls are known invites the breach. This truth governs all dominion, for power resides not merely in the strength of the arm, but in the obscurity of the intent. Moreover, the wise prince knows that men attack only what they perceive, and perception requires pattern. The Gatekeeper who lays bare his mind to his subordinates invites his own destruction, for familiarity breeds not merely contempt, but calculation.

Either the servant fears his master, or he schemes against him—there exists no middle state. When he fears, he obeys; when he schemes, he has already begun to rule. Therefore, if the servant knows the master's habit—the hour of his rising, the nature of his anger, the price of his favor—he ceases to fear and begins to calculate. He anticipates the command before it is given, and in anticipation lies the seed of usurpation. To be predictable is to be led, for men by nature seek to master what they understand.

Some will protest that consistency demonstrates virtue, that the regular man inspires trust. These men understand neither the nature of power nor the heart of man. Trust is but the prelude to betrayal, and the regular man is merely the easiest to destroy. The Gatekeeper must therefore cloak himself in shadow, cultivating a silence that unnerves and a caprice that confounds. He must be as the serpent in the garden—visible when he strikes, invisible when he waits. Obscurity is a shield that weighs nothing; furthermore, it is the only defense that cannot be battered down, for one cannot strike what one cannot locate.

II. EXAMPLE

Learn from the ruin of Bertoldo Malvezzi, chamberlain to Giovanni II of Bologna. For seven years, Bertoldo held the keys to the House of Bentivoglio with the grip of a mastiff guarding his master's threshold. He was a man of exemplary diligence, keeping the accounts with the precision of a Venetian merchant and guarding the lord's door with the regularity of the tides. This virtue—for so he deemed it—was his undoing.

Bertoldo believed that consistency was nobility itself. Each dawn, he rose at the toll of San Petronio's bell. He broke his fast with white bread and watered wine, neither more nor less. He granted audiences in an order as fixed as the stars—merchants at the third hour, petitioners at the fifth, nobles at the seventh. The corridors of the palazzo echoed with the measured tread of his boots, always the same pace, always the same path. It was said in Bologna that a petition presented on a Tuesday after morning mass would be granted, while one presented before the noon meal would be refused. A gift of Rhenish silver bought a minute of his time; a gift of Florentine gold bought an hour. He had become a law of nature, rigid and readable as the phases of the moon.

"Bertoldo is as the sundial," the courtiers would jest, "useful for telling time, useless for anything else."

For a time, the household prospered, or so it seemed to those who mistake order for strength. Yet in the shadows waited Giacomo Isolani, third son of a bankrupt silk merchant. Giacomo possessed neither land nor title, neither beauty nor charm. What he possessed was the cold eye of the wolf who watches the fold. For six months, he did nothing but observe Bertoldo, studying him as a physician studies the humors. He noted that the chamberlain always refused requests on Fridays, being given to fasting. He observed that mention of the House of Orsini softened Bertoldo's countenance, for his mother had been nursed by an Orsini woman. He discovered that the chamberlain could not bear the tears of widows, having lost his own mother young.

"I need not defeat Bertoldo," Giacomo told his sole confidant, a defrocked priest named Corso. "His habits will defeat him for me."

Thus armed with knowledge sharper than any dagger, Giacomo struck. Yet he did not use steel, but the chamberlain's own predictability as his weapon.

First, knowing Bertoldo refused all petitions on days of fasting, Giacomo arranged for a vital trade agreement from the Medici bank—terms most favorable to Bologna—to be presented on a Friday. The messenger, coached by Giacomo, arrived precisely at the hour when Bertoldo's hunger made him most irritable. Bertoldo refused it by rote, scarcely glancing at the seal. When Giovanni learned that his chamberlain had spurned an alliance worth ten thousand ducats, his face darkened like the sky before thunder.

Second, knowing Bertoldo's sentimental weakness for the House of Orsini, Giacomo spread whispers that the Bentivoglio sought to shun these old rivals. When an Orsini cousin arrived seeking shelter from creditors—a man of notorious corruption—Bertoldo granted him sanctuary and gold, as his habit dictated. To Giovanni, this appeared not as loyalty but as defiance of his policy. "Does my chamberlain serve me," the lord asked his council, "or does he serve his childhood memories?"

Third, knowing Bertoldo could not withstand the tears of a woman, Giacomo employed the most cunning stratagem. He found a comely widow whose husband had perished owing five hundred ducats to Giovanni's chief banker, Lodovico Pepoli. The widow, tutored by Giacomo in the art of grief, appeared before Bertoldo with her three children, all dressed in rags he had procured. She wept so piteously that the very stones might have softened. Bertoldo, moved by his predictable pity, not only forgave the debt but granted her a pension from the lord's own purse. When Pepoli discovered this generosity with his money, he stormed to Giovanni: "Either your chamberlain is a fool, or he seeks to ruin you through kindness!"

The trap was perfectly sprung. Giovanni summoned Bertoldo on the Feast of San Michele. The chamberlain entered the presence at his customary measured pace, unaware that his steps led to exile.

"You have served with the consistency of the tide," Giovanni said, his voice as cold as the Alpine wind. "Yet the tide serves no master but the moon. I require a servant who serves only me."

Bertoldo was dismissed within the hour, his rigid competence proven a liability. Giacomo Isolani took the keys before the sun set.

Here the lesson sharpens like a blade on the whetstone. Giacomo did not repeat his predecessor's error. Where Bertoldo had been as regular as the cathedral bells, Giacomo became a creature of smoke and shadow. He rose at dawn one day and at noon the next. Sometimes he did not rise at all, conducting business from his bed or while walking in the gardens. He received the lowest beggar before the highest duke, or kept princes waiting while he spoke with stable boys. He was harsh when expected to be mild, generous when expected to be cruel. 

The court was thrown into beautiful disarray. One morning, a silk merchant arrived with gifts of amber and pearls, certain of gaining an audience—Giacomo had him thrown out for presumption. That afternoon, a penniless scholar approached with empty hands and received an hour of the chamberlain's time plus a purse of gold. The next week, the same merchant was welcomed with honors while the scholar was ignored.

"Madness!" cried the courtiers. "The man governs by whim!"

"Either he is mad, or we are blind," observed Count Malatesta, the wisest of Giovanni's counselors. "I suspect we are blind."

Nevertheless, the complaints multiplied. Deputations approached Giovanni, begging him to restore order. "Lord," they pleaded, "under Bertoldo we knew where we stood. Under this Isolani, we stumble in darkness."

Giovanni smiled the smile of the lion who hears the sheep complain about the shepherd's dog. "Under Bertoldo, you knew where he stood, and thus you ruled him. Under Giacomo, you know nothing, and thus he rules you. Which serves me better?"

The courtiers had no answer, for men rarely appreciate the chains that bind them until those chains are used to their disadvantage.

Giacomo perfected his art. He developed three faces—the benevolent uncle, the stern judge, and the distracted philosopher—and wore them without pattern. Some days he quoted Cicero; others, he spoke only in the vulgar tongue. He kept three different chambers for receiving guests and chose among them by some design known only to himself. His very appearance shifted: one day dressed as a prince, the next as a clerk, and once—to the horror of the court—as a common laborer.

"How can we petition a man who changes like the weather?" lamented the Bishop of Imola.

"You cannot," Giacomo replied when this reached his ears. "And therein lies your education."

For nineteen years, Giacomo served as chamberlain, a riddle wrapped in silk and shadow. No conspiracy could form against him, for conspiracies require prediction, and he was as unpredictable as the flight of the falcon. He died in his bed at sixty-three, wealthy and feared, having never allowed a single soul to know his true mind. At his funeral, twenty different men claimed to have been his closest friend; not one could say with certainty what he had believed or loved.

III. LESSON

From the fall of the clockwork man and the rise of the shadow, we draw these essential principles:

First, consistency is confession written in the ink of time. Every repeated act gives the enemy the measure of your stride; accordingly, once measured, you are finite, and once finite, you are conquerable. The Gatekeeper must never allow his patterns to harden into chains. Either you rule your habits, or your habits deliver you to your enemies—no middle ground exists in this matter.

Second, there exists a via di mezzo between perfect order and complete chaos. The fool changes his mind because he knows not what he wants; the master changes his face to prevent others from knowing. Giacomo was not erratic for the sake of disorder—such would be the way of the weak-minded. Rather, he wielded inconsistency as a weapon, maintaining internal purpose while projecting external confusion. This middle way between rigidity and madness never or rarely fails to preserve authority.

Third, men strike only at what they can see, for human nature compels us to attack the visible and fear the invisible. The court destroyed Bertoldo because they knew where he stood each hour of each day. They could not strike Giacomo because he was never in the same place twice. Consequently, to remain formless is to remain unassailable. As the fox eludes the hunter by doubling back on its trail, so must the Gatekeeper elude prediction by doubling back on his patterns.

Fourth, you must watch yourself with the eye of an assassin. Each day, ask: what has my enemy learned of me this week? If the answer comes readily, you have already failed. Human nature drives men to seek patterns as the hawk seeks mice—inevitably and relentlessly. Therefore, you must break your patterns before they break you. This practice of self-scrutiny never or rarely fails to reveal dangerous regularities.

Fifth, the illegible servant is the eternal servant. Either a man can be read by the crowd, or he remains loyal to his master—these states cannot coexist. He who cannot be predicted cannot be purchased, for men buy only what they understand. By keeping his own counsel and varying his ways, the Gatekeeper preserves not merely his position but his master's dominion. This principle never or rarely fails: the mysterious servant survives while the transparent one perishes.

IV. CLOSING

Make of your mind a labyrinth without a thread, for the man who can be mapped is already conquered.
