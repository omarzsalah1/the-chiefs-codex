CHAPTER XIX

OF THE TRUE NATURE OF POWER

Men are deceived by the corporeal, believing that power resides in what can be touched and tallied. They count their ducats, number their soldiers, and measure their fortresses, thinking these constitute their dominion. Yet either power dwells in material substance or it dwells in the perception thereof. Not in substance—for history shows us mighty princes with vast armies overthrown by lesser men. Therefore, power dwells in perception.

The prince who commands but one hundred men-at-arms, yet is believed to command one thousand, possesses the strength of the larger force. Conversely, he who truly commands one thousand, but is thought weak, shall be treated as prey by wolves who would flee from the lion's shadow. For men act not upon what is, but upon what they believe to be.

Some will object that armies and gold are real, whilst perception is mere vapor. To these I answer: the vapor that obscures the mountain makes it seem larger; the mist that conceals the precipice prevents the fall. Moreover, maintaining the shadow of power costs nothing, whilst maintaining its substance bleeds the treasury dry. The wise prince therefore cultivates both, but relies more heavily upon the former, for it never deserts him in his hour of need.

Consider the instructive case of Count Ridolfo della Rocca, who held the small fortress of Montescuro in the Marches during the year of Our Lord 1487. His position was most precarious—nay, desperate. To the east prowled the Baglioni of Perugia, those wolves who had devoured greater prey than he. To the west circled the Vitelli of Città di Castello, falcons whose talons had rent apart mightier fortresses. The Count's treasury contained scarce three hundred florins, his garrison numbered but sixty men, half of them past their prime, and his walls showed gaps where winter storms had pulled away the stones.

Any prudent counselor would have advised immediate surrender or flight. Yet Count Ridolfo understood a fundamental truth of human nature: men fear most what they cannot clearly perceive, as the mastiff barks loudest at shadows in the night.

"My lord," said his captain, one Ser Giacomo, a grizzled veteran of the Lombard wars, "we must hire more soldiers or treat for terms. We cannot hold against either the Baglioni or the Vitelli, much less both."

"Tell me, Giacomo," replied the Count, pouring two cups of the thin wine that was all his cellar afforded, "which would cost less—one hundred soldiers or one hundred lies?"

"Lies cost nothing, my lord, but they also defend nothing."

"Do they not? Watch and learn."

The Count dismissed thirty of his soldiers—men he could not pay regardless—keeping only the thirty most reliable. With the saved wages, he hired six scribes and a painter of notable skill. His captain thought him mad; nevertheless, the Count proceeded with his strategem.

The scribes he set to work forging correspondence. Letters to the Duke of Urbino discussing mutual defense pacts that existed only in ink. Missives to Venetian merchants arranging loans of forty thousand ducats. Orders to condottieri captains to prepare their companies for spring muster at Montescuro. Most cunningly, he had drafted a letter from the Pope himself, promising spiritual sanctions against any who violated della Rocca lands.

These letters were never sent by courier. Instead, they were carefully lost. One was left beneath a wine-stained table at an inn frequented by Baglioni spies. Another was tucked into a saddlebag, then the horse was sold to a merchant known to trade information with the Vitelli. A third was hidden in the false bottom of a chest, which was then ostentatiously searched at the city gates, ensuring the "secret" compartment would be discovered.

"Men believe most firmly what they steal," the Count explained to his doubtful captain. "Give a man information and he questions its source. Let him discover it through cunning and he swears by its truth."

Furthermore, the Count employed his painter to create false banners—the devices of the famous Company of San Giorgio, the black bands of Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, the silver eagles of the Colonnas. These banners were hung from the walls at dawn, taken down at dusk, then replaced with others the next morning.

The human eye sees what the mind expects. Thus, when Vitelli scouts observed the changing banners, they reported that multiple mercenary companies were reinforcing Montescuro. When Baglioni spies noted provisioning wagons entering the gates—the same three wagons circling the fortress and re-entering repeatedly—they calculated that vast supplies were being laid in for a siege.

The Count then played his masterstroke. He sent his remaining thirty men, divided into groups of ten, to light watchfires in the hills surrounding Montescuro. Each group maintained fires for one hundred men, moving them nightly to suggest patrol patterns. The darkness transformed thirty soldiers into three hundred. Drums beat the watches, horns sounded the changes, and voices carried across the valleys—the same voices, but the night made them legion.

When Gianpaolo Baglioni himself rode forth to inspect these alarming developments, he brought with him only a small reconnaissance force, for either Count della Rocca commanded the mighty army the signs suggested, or he was defenseless. Not defenseless—else why the constant activity, the changing banners, the multitude of fires? Therefore, he commanded a mighty army.

"My lord Baglioni," called Count Ridolfo from his walls, standing between two of his youngest soldiers dressed in the finest armor the fortress possessed, "to what do I owe the honor of your visit?"

"I come to see for myself these famous reinforcements of yours, Count. My scouts speak of nothing else."

"Your scouts have keen eyes. Would you care to enter and review my forces? Though I warn you—my Swiss guards are somewhat... enthusiastic in their duties."

The Count had no Swiss guards. Yet Baglioni, seeing the confidence in della Rocca's bearing, hearing the casual mention of Swiss—the most feared soldiers in all Italy—chose the path of prudence. For this is another truth of human nature: when uncertain, men rarely risk all on a single throw of the dice.

"Another time, perhaps, Count. I merely wished to pay my respects to a neighbor who has so many powerful friends."

Gianpaolo withdrew. Within days, he sent an embassy proposing a treaty of mutual respect. The Vitelli, learning of this, hastened to do likewise, for men never or rarely fail to seek accommodation with rising powers.

Yet the Count knew that illusion without foundation is like a house built on sand. Therefore, with the breathing space his deceptions had purchased, he set about creating reality from shadow. The treaties brought legitimacy. Legitimacy attracted merchants. Merchants brought taxes. Taxes enabled him to hire true soldiers—not many, but enough. The lie became truth through careful cultivation.

Some would argue that such deception cannot last, that eventually the mask must fall. To these I say: observe that Count della Rocca held Montescuro for seventeen years, dying peacefully in his bed, leaving his son a respected if modest state. How many princes with larger armies and fuller treasuries can claim as much?

From this example, the wise chief of staff should extract these principles:

First, that perception never or rarely fails to precede reality in matters of power. Men act upon what they believe, not upon what is. Master the former and you control the latter.

Second, that the mind supplies what the eye cannot fully see. Give men fragments of evidence pointing to strength, and their imagination will complete the picture more thoroughly than any reality could. Consequently, the chief should cultivate mystery as carefully as he cultivates capability.

Third, that between the extremes of complete honesty and complete fabrication lies the via di mezzo of strategic ambiguity. Not truth, not lies, but careful orchestration of partial truths that lead observers to draw the conclusions you desire.

Fourth, that stolen intelligence is believed absolutely, whilst given intelligence is suspected always. Therefore, the chief should take as much care in what he allows to be discovered as in what he deliberately reveals.

Fifth, that men are like serpents—they strike at what seems weak and recoil from what seems strong. The appearance of power attracts power, as the moon pulls the tides. Hence, the chief who projects strength magnetizes allies and resources that make the projection real.

Nevertheless, a warning must be given: either power rests on some foundation of reality or it collapses at the first test. Not on pure fabrication—for even Count della Rocca maintained his thirty loyal men and his fortress walls. Therefore, on some foundation of reality. The shadow requires an object to cast it; the echo requires a voice to create it. The chief who forgets this truth builds upon quicksand.

Power is the terror in the enemy's mind before the battle is joined.
