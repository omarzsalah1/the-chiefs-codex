### I. The Principle Stated

He who holds the door commands the house.

The general of ten thousand spears commands naught if his voice finds no captains. The merchant possessing mountains of silk holds only dust if the buyer finds not his threshold. The prince who rules a vast dominion rules a phantom realm if petitioners reach not his ear—or reach it only by another’s leave.

Ambition errs; it seeks the throne when it should seek the antechamber. It covets the seal when it should covet the threshold. The throne is fixed, a mark for every blade. The corridor is a living throat; it swallows or speaks at the keeper's will.

The gatekeeper wears no crown, yet he decides who shall see it.
