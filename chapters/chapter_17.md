CHAPTER XVII

ON THE SUCCESSION AND THE PERILOUS INTERVAL

No moment breeds more danger than that twilight between the old prince's final breath and the new prince's first command. For in this hour, the secretary faces the cruelest choice: either he secures his position through cunning foresight, or he perishes through naive faith. There exists no middle ground. The faithful servant who has grown fat under his master's protection discovers that loyalty to the dead is treason to the living. Moreover, the new prince arrives not as a solitary figure, but as the head of a pack of hungry wolves who have long prowled the borders of power, awaiting their feast.

These ravenous men seek not wisdom from the old counselors; they seek their gold, their offices, and the very marrow from their bones. He who believes his competence shall shield him from the tempest deceives himself with fatal delusion. For men by nature prefer to reward their friends than to retain their enemies, and the servant of the father must always appear as the enemy of the son. Furthermore, youth despises nothing more than the shadow of age, and new princes burn to prove themselves distinct from their predecessors.

Some will object that a wise prince must retain experienced ministers, for the state requires continuity. Nevertheless, this reasoning assumes princes act from wisdom rather than passion. Either princes are rational beings who calculate advantage, or they are men driven by pride and the whispers of flatterers. Since we observe the latter more than the former, the prudent secretary must plan accordingly.

THE DESTRUCTION OF ANTONIO MALASPINA

Consider the fate of Antonio Malaspina, who served as Chancellor to Duke Francesco of Ferrara for thirty winters. This man possessed a memory like carved marble and a will that bent for no man save his master. He rose from the dust of a notary's shop to command the very breath of the duchy. No letter reached the Duke without Antonio's seal; no florin departed the treasury without his mark; no ambassador gained audience save by his permission.

When the Bentivoglio conspired against the state, Antonio uncovered their plots with the patience of a mastiff tracking blood through snow. When the merchants of Venice sought to strangle Ferrara's trade, he negotiated treaties that turned their greed against itself like a serpent swallowing its own tail. The Duke called him "my right hand," and indeed, Antonio's hand moved all the levers of state with such precision that the machinery of government seemed to breathe through his will alone.

The Chancellor's study stood at the heart of the palace, its walls lined with ledgers bound in Florentine leather, each spine marked with his cipher. Here he worked from cock's crow to midnight bell, his quill scratching endless calculations while a single candle cast dancing shadows. The servants whispered that he never slept, that he sustained himself on bitter herbs and watered wine. In truth, Antonio slept little, for he understood that vigilance never fails to preserve power—or so he believed.

Duke Francesco, however, was mortal flesh, and by his seventieth year, the tremor in his hands had spread to his voice. His son Ercole burned with the fever of youth and the counsel of ambitious men. Chief among these parasites stood Jacopo Tornabuoni, a man of ancient name but empty purse, whose grandfather had squandered the family fortune on alchemists and courtesans. Beside him prowled Filippo Strozzi, whose eloquence exceeded his wisdom as the peacock's plumage exceeds its worth.

These men met in the shadows of the palace gardens, where the fountain's splash masked their whispers. "Why should you inherit your father's servant when you might appoint your own?" Jacopo would murmur, his breath reeking of sour wine. "Either you begin your reign as your own man, or you remain forever a boy wearing his father's clothes."

Filippo, ever the rhetorician, would add: "Consider, my lord, how Antonio knows every secret, controls every purse string. Either he serves you truly, or he holds a dagger to your throat. Can you trust a man who has tasted such power?"

Antonio observed the Duke's health failing like a candle drowning in its own wax. The old man's coughs echoed through the palace halls, each one wet with blood. Yet the Chancellor reasoned thus: "The young prince knows nothing of our debts to France, nor the secret pacts with the condottieri, nor the true state of our finances. Either he must retain me or watch the duchy crumble. Therefore, I am as necessary to the son as the foundation to the house."

But herein lay his fatal error. For men judge necessity not by reason but by pride, and the young prefer ruin of their own making to prosperity inherited from their fathers. Antonio mistook competence for armor, when in truth it was the very weapon his enemies would turn against him. He failed to see that knowledge itself can be a crime when possessed by the wrong hands.

On the eve of the Duke's death, Antonio stood vigil in the chapel, the smell of incense mixing with the stench of impending mortality. Duke Francesco's breathing rattled like dice in a cup. "Promise me," the dying man whispered, his fingers cold as winter stone against Antonio's wrist, "promise you will serve my son as you have served me."

"I swear it, Your Grace," Antonio replied, and sealed his doom with those words.

The Duke died at dawn, his last breath misting in the cold morning air. Antonio, following ancient protocol, broke the seal of state and prepared to deliver it to the heir. But when he entered the great hall, he found it already occupied. Young Ercole sat upon his father's throne, Jacopo and Filippo flanking him like carrion crows. The new Duke's face bore the false solemnity of youth playing at gravitas.

"Good Antonio," Ercole said, his voice sweet as poisoned wine, "you who served my father so faithfully must now serve the son. Tell me all the secrets of our state, for I would learn from your wisdom."

For seven days, Antonio opened every coffer of knowledge. He revealed the names of spies in Milan, the weakness in our southern fortifications, the true sum owed to Venetian bankers. He showed where the emergency gold was buried beneath the palace foundations and which nobles could be trusted with their lives. Each night, Jacopo and Filippo took careful notes, their eyes glittering with avarice.

On the eighth day, as Antonio entered the palace through the servants' gate—his usual custom to avoid pomp—Jacopo Tornabuoni met him with twenty guards in new livery. The morning sun caught on their polished breastplates, blinding the old Chancellor.

"Antonio Malaspina," Jacopo proclaimed, reading from a scroll that still dripped with fresh ink, "you stand accused of embezzlement from the ducal treasury, of selling the secrets of Ferrara to our enemies, and of poisoning the mind of our late Duke against his noble son."

"These are lies!" Antonio cried, his voice echoing off the marble columns. "I have served faithfully for thirty years. Let any man come forward with proof of my crimes!"

But the trial was mere theater, a play where every actor knew his lines. Merchants testified that Antonio had taken bribes—these same merchants had been promised his confiscated estates. Servants swore they had seen him burn evidence—these servants now wore the livery of Filippo Strozzi. A Milanese spy, conveniently captured, claimed Antonio had sold him information—though the man spoke with a Ferrarese accent. Consequently, the verdict had been written before the accusation.

The wise man might ask: why did Antonio not flee when he saw the wolves gathering? Here we observe how men by nature cling to hope beyond reason. Either one reads the signs and acts, or one denies them and perishes. Antonio chose denial, believing his decades of service would speak louder than whispered lies.

Within a fortnight, Antonio found himself stripped of honors, his property divided among his accusers like wolves tearing at a carcass. Jacopo claimed the Chancellor's seal and the great house on the Via Larga; Filippo took the country villa where Antonio's children had played among the lemon trees. The library Antonio had assembled over thirty years—manuscripts from Constantinople, maps of the New World—was scattered to the wind, sold to pay for young Ercole's coronation feast.

The old man fled to Rome with nothing but the clothes on his back and a single purse of gold sewn into his cloak—a via di mezzo between destitution and wealth that barely sustained him. He was saved from execution only because Pope Julius found use for a discarded tool who knew Ferrara's secrets. There Antonio lived ten more winters, fed by papal gold but dead in spirit, writing letters to friends who no longer dared respond. His hand, which once signed treaties that shook kingdoms, now trembled as he begged for his pension.

As for Ferrara, the duchy bled from a thousand wounds. The new men, drunk on their sudden elevation, offended France through ignorance and emptied the treasury through greed. Jacopo, knowing nothing of diplomatic subtlety, insulted the French ambassador over precedence at a feast. Filippo, eager to display his new wealth, spent the emergency gold on Flemish tapestries and Spanish horses. Within three years, Ercole found himself a puppet of foreign powers, dancing to strings he could not see. The competence he had discarded for loyalty he now needed for survival, but it was ash scattered to the winds.

Some might argue that Ercole acted from necessity, that he needed to establish his own authority. Yet observe the result: either a prince preserves the state through wisdom or destroys it through pride. Young Ercole chose destruction, and thus proved that men by nature prefer to rule over ruins than to prosper under another's shadow.

THE LESSONS OF SUCCESSION

From this ruin, we extract these principles, each written in blood:

First, the servant must recognize that power flows like water from the high to the low. When the mountain crumbles, the stream must find a new course or perish in drought. Either the counselor secures his position before the succession, or he prepares his escape. To wait upon events is to wait upon the executioner. This via di mezzo between action and patience rarely fails to preserve life, if not position.

Second, the wise minister cultivates not one master but two. While serving the father with the fidelity of a hound, he must court the son with the subtlety of a serpent. This middle way between present duty and future survival never fails to preserve the prudent man. For he who serves only the dying serves his own death warrant. Hence, the secretary must be like the falcon that sees both mouse and sky.

Third, when the bell tolls for the old prince, the counselor must read the signs like a sailor reads the storm clouds. If the heir surrounds himself with new men, departure must be swift. If he speaks of "reform" and "new beginnings," these are but euphemisms for purge. The fox does not debate with the hunter; he vanishes into the forest. Accordingly, preparation must precede catastrophe.

Fourth, the secretary must never mistake his usefulness for protection. Men value not what they need but what they desire, and new princes desire above all to appear independent of their fathers' shadows. Furthermore, the knowledge that makes one indispensable also makes one dangerous. Either the prince must trust you entirely, or he must destroy you entirely. Since trust is rarer than phoenix feathers, destruction follows as night follows day. This truth never or rarely fails to manifest itself in the corridors of power.

Fifth, wealth and alliances must be cultivated beyond the borders of one's immediate master. The prudent man maintains friends in foreign courts and gold in foreign banks. For when the storm breaks, these shall be his ark. He who places all his fortune in one prince's hands places his neck in the noose. Thus, the via di mezzo between concentration and dispersal of assets preserves both wealth and life.

Some will protest that such precautions display disloyalty. Nevertheless, observe how loyalty without prudence leads to destruction, while prudence without loyalty at least preserves life. Either one serves with blind faith and perishes, or one serves with open eyes and survives. The choice is clear to all but fools.

THE FINAL MAXIM

The same loyalty that made you necessary to the dead prince makes you intolerable to the living one; therefore, the wise servant serves the son before he buries the father.
